/T_h  e strength of the Fund comes from its talented and diverse employees. Together, we represent a world 
of cultures, backgrounds, and skills that can only be fully engaged if we continuously recognize and value our diﬀ  erences and live our core Fund values of excellence, honesty, impartiality, inclusion, integrity, and respect . With inclusion as one of those core values, our legitimacy and credibility stem from our 
ability to be truly inclusive so that our employees can perform at their best to serve our membership.
The IMF continues to make strides in gender representation. For the ﬁ  rst time 
in its history, three of the Fund’s ﬁ  ve top leaders are women and since October 2019, half of the newly appointed Heads of Departments and O/uniFB03   ces are women. 
Our e/uniFB00  orts to have a more balanced regional representation continued, notwith-
standing the pandemic. We leveraged digital platforms to increase our recruitment missions three-fold, with much of this increase focused on our three under-rep-resented regions. While we were able to meet our objectives for two of these, Sub-Saharan Africa, and East Asia, we continue to face challenges in achieving the representation we aspire to for sta/uniFB00   from the Middle East and North Africa. 
Since 2019, we have implemented a more robust accountability mechanism to 
ensure that managers contribute more proactively to achieving our diversity objectives and creating a more inclusive work environment through their recruit-ment, sta/uniFB00   development, performance assessment, and promotion decisions. While we maintain our focus on gender and regional representation, we are expanding the scope of our inclusion e/uniFB00  orts. For instance, we have focused many of our initiatives towards promoting racial equity and justice and gaining a better understanding of the full diversity of our sta/uniFB00  . We have also relaunched a working group on disabilities and created an Employee Resource Group, THRIVE, to ensure that employees with a disability and those caring for dependents with disabilities have a voice in shaping our future work environment. 
Each one of us is responsible for contributing to diversity and inclusion. The e/uniFB00  ort 
of nurturing a culture of inclusion is challenging, but possible through continu-ously adjusting behaviors and creating an environment where we all feel a sense of belonging. We must all work together to continue to build on the progress already made and to achieve the diverse and inclusive Fund that we all desire.

IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce iv
/T_h  is report provides a high-level update on the status of diversity and inclusion (D&I) in the IMF for 
/f_i  scal years (FYs) 2020 and 2021. /T_h  e data on staﬀ   composition and the status against benchmarks are as of the end of FY 2021, whereas for recruitment, promotions, and separations, the data cover a /f_i  ve-year period from FY 2017 through FY 2021. /T_h  e initial sections of the report focus on diversity within the IMF, in recruitment, promotions, and separations; the second half presents measures put in place to foster greater inclusion and hold managers more accountable and provides a two-year roadmap to address continuing challenges. A summary of the results of the annual pay gap analysis (PGA), conducted in FY 2021, which for the /f_i  rst time included a race component, is available in Annex 1.
Sta/uniFB00   Composition: The composition of IMF employees by gender, career stream, 
region, and education has not signiﬁ  cantly changed since the 2019 D&I Report, although the IMF has seen an increase in the share of contractual employees in the last two years.
Status against the FY 2025 Benchmarks : The share of sta/uniFB00   members at the indi-
vidual contributor level (A9–A14/A15) has exceeded the benchmarks for nationals 
from East Asia (15.2 percent vs. 15 percent target) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (9.2 percent vs. 8 percent target), but the IMF continues to struggle to meet the benchmark for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA+) region (5.7 percent vs 8 percent target). At the managerial level, the new benchmark framework increased the targets for representation of both women and those from underrepresented regions (URRs). As such, at the end of FY 2021, attainment of managerial bench-marks is considerably lagging across the board, although sustained progress has been seen in the share of women in these roles, and there is su/uniFB03   cient time to meet the targets.
Recruitment:  The IMF leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions by 
pivoting to virtual sourcing and talent attraction, increasing the number of recruit-
ment missions by 300 percent. Hiring trends show an improvement in the share of MENA+ nationals recruited, particularly in FY 2021, but progress remains slow.
Promotions:  The report covers promotions from professional to managerial roles 
and from administrative to professional levels. The trend of higher rates of promo-
tion for women continues/uni003B however, there are considerable di/uniFB00  erences in the rates of promotion between women from URRs and women from Other Regions (all regions  combined, except for URRs).Separations:  The current separation rate is about 5 percent, with most sepa-
rations due to retirements. The number of voluntary resignations has steadily decreased since 2017. Over the last ﬁ  ve years, nationals of the MENA+ region had a higher rate of voluntary resignations than those from the other two URRs as well as a slightly higher rate than the IMF average of 1.5 percent.
Inclusion : Several important initiatives were launched in the last two years to 
foster a more inclusive work environment in which the IMF’s diverse sta/uniFB00   can 
thrive. Racial equity and justice are now squarely on the IMF’s agenda, and URR nationals are participating in a pilot Sponsorship Program. The IMF has started to look at its policies and practices as they relate to people who identify as having a disability, and the mandatory D&I training has been updated.
Holding Managers Accountable:  As indicated in the 2019 Report, managerial 
accountability for achieving D&I results needs to be strengthened. To this end, 
the IMF implemented departmental action plans in FY 2021 and is updating the Accountability Framework to reﬂ  ect the FY 2025 benchmarks and key indicators included in the departmental action plans. A D&I Survey was launched in March 2021 to gauge sta/uniFB00   perceptions around, among others, belonging, inclusion, discrimination, and harassment.
Two-Year Framework : Over the next two years, the focus will be on leveraging 
the approved headcount increase and higher number of retirements to improve 
the diversity of the IMF’s sta/uniFB00  . In addition, the Fund will systematically monitor rates of promotion, implement actions to ensure equitable opportunities for career development, and continue to improve its accountability mechanisms.
2020–2021 Report 1
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) continue to be business priorities for the IMF, with the full support of 
the IMF’s Management. D&I eﬀ  orts are based on the need to ensure a level playing /f_i  eld and equitable treatment for all staﬀ   in terms of recruitment, career development, and growth opportunities.
Since the last D&I Report in 2019, the Managing Director has reasserted the 
IMF’s commitment to D&I by issuing an updated Diversity & Inclusion statement,1 
endorsing the FY 2025 Benchmarks framework and targets, and approving the inclusion of an expanded nondiscrimination clause in the high-level principles governing the employment policies and practices in the IMF’s Sta/uniFB00   Handbook.
The last IMF D&I Report proposed a signiﬁ  cant number of actions to achieve 
progress against objectives. The 2019 D&I Report proposed a total of 46 actions, covering a range of initiatives related to recruitment, career management, and accountability. In addition, the 2025 D&I Benchmarks Working Group proposed 35 initiatives to increase the likelihood of achieving the FY 2025 Benchmarks. As the actions and initiatives were designed to span a period of one to ﬁ  ve years, there was no assumption that all would be started or implemented by the date of this report, and many are meant to be ongoing.
As a preamble to this 2020–21 D&I Report, it is worth taking stock of the progress 
made in the implementation of the actions to date. Table 1 provides a numerical summary of the proposed initiatives and the progress toward their implementa-tion. Of the 81 actions, 9 (11 percent) have been completed, and 34 (42 percent) are underway. The IMF will progressively implement most of the remainder over the next three years and will consider three of the recommendations on a longer-term horizon. 
This 2020–21 D&I Report presents an overview of the IMF’s accomplishments as 
well as its remaining challenges.

IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 2
To take the ﬁ  rst step in identifying gaps, an organization must determine where 
it stands in the diversity of its population. As an international organization, the IMF has a duty to reﬂ  ect its membership in the composition of its sta/uniFB00  .
2 Looking 
at the overall population, women account for 47 percent of total employees (the same as in the previous report) but only 31 percent of economists (a 0.8 percent increase since end FY 2019). Nationals from underrepresented regions (URRs)
3 
represent 27 percent of sta/uniFB00  . Interestingly, women are more represented among 
URR nationals than in Other Regions.4
2  Article XII reads in part: In appointing the sta/uniFB00   the Managing Director shall, subject to the paramount 
importance of securing the highest standards of e/uniFB03   ciency and technical competence, pay due regard to the 
importance of recruiting personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible.”
3  There are three under-represented regions East Asia, Middle East and North Africa+ (MENA+), and sub-Saharan 
Africa (SSA). Annex 2 provides a list of individual countries represented in each region.
4  “Other Regions” refers to all regions excluding URRs: that is, Asia (excl. East Asia), Europe (excl. Transition 
Countries), Other Western Hemisphere, Transition Countries, and the United States & Canada. A full list of coun-tries under each regional group can be found in Annex 3, Table 9.Setting targets (referred to as “benchmarks” at the IMF) is a way of providing an 
impetus to increase diversity over time. The IMF ﬁ  rst established benchmarks in 2003 and has revised them several times as targets were met, and further prog-ress was deemed necessary. In early FY 2021, a new benchmark framework set the IMF on a path to achieve greater progress by the end of FY 2025. Additional details on the new framework and targets can be found in the “Holding Managers Accountable” section. This section provides a high-level view of the IMF’s popula-tion by gender, URR, career stream,
5 and educational diversity, as well as detailed 
progress to date against the new FY 2025 Benchmarks.
5  There are two main career streams in the IMF: Economists and the Specialized Career Stream.

Sta/uniFB00   composition is the starting point for identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement. This section provides a high-level summary of the diversity of IMF employees, both sta/uniFB00   and contractual,
6 who represent 151 member countries at 
the end of FY 2021.
Figure 1 shows an overview of the gender distribution of employees by regional 
grouping, career stream, and employment type. The overall balance between women and men remains stable. Interestingly, women make up more than half of URR employees, compared to 45 percent in Other Regions. While the IMF would like to see a higher representation of women in the Economist stream, the ﬁ  gures are in line with the industry (see The Economist )
7. The share of men 
in the contractual employment category has risen by 2.7 percentage points to 44.8 percent in the last two years, which reﬂ  ects increased hiring of contractual employees at professional levels.
6 Contractual employees with contracts of one year or more.

2020–2021 Report 3
The overall distribution of sta/uniFB00   and contractual employees by gender and career 
stream can be found in Figure 2. The share of sta/uniFB00   versus contractual employees has dropped slightly from 82.2 percent at the end of FY 2019 to 80.8 percent at the end of FY 2021, driven by an increase in the share of contractual employees in the Economist career stream. The higher share of female contractual employees in the Specialized Career Stream reﬂ  ects the concentration of assistant and administrative roles in this stream. Figure 2.

Figure 3 provides a more granular breakdown of the share of sta/uniFB00   by region and grade group and the share of sta/uniFB00   by region and gender, respectively. URR nationals represent 27 percent of the total sta/uniFB00   population—a 1 percentage point increase since the end of FY 2019, fueled primarily by higher shares of sta/uniFB00   from sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. In managerial roles, however, URR nationals comprise only 17.6 percent versus a cumulative benchmark of 28 percent.
Europe (excluding Transition Countries
8) has the highest overall representation (Figure 
3, panel 1). European nationals represent 24.5 percent of the sta/uniFB00   population, of which 
19.2 percent (almost one in ﬁ  ve) are B-level managers—accounting for 37.6 percent of all B-level managers. Similarly, while representing 7.5 percent of total sta/uniFB00  , 20 percent (one in ﬁ  ve) of Asian (excluding East Asia) nationals are B-level managers. For other regions, however, the picture is quite di/uniFB00  erent: the ratio of B-level managers to sta/uniFB00   ranges from one in eight (United States & Canada and MENA+) to one in ﬁ  fteen and one in twenty-two, respectively, for sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.

Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, 
Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.Looking at gender by region, some notable di/uniFB00  erences emerge (Figure 3, panel 2). 
European women account for only one in three (33.5 percent) of their nationals, the lowest ratio amongst all the regional groupings. Women from sub-Saharan Africa, MENA+, Asia (excluding East Asia), and Other Western Hemisphere all represent more than 40 percent of their nationals, whereas one in two sta/uniFB00   members from East Asia, Transition Countries, and the United States & Canada are women.
When looking at the distribution by region, career stream, and gender (Figure 4, 
panel 1), there are some shifts compared to those reported in the 2019 Report (Figure 4, panel 2). In the Economist stream, the shares of nationals from the United States & Canada, Transition Countries, and Europe have decreased, while the shares of sta/uniFB00   from the three URRs have increased. These shifts in representation can largely be attributed to increased e/uniFB00  orts to source candidates from URRs, especially through the midcareer economist process. For the Specialized Career Streams, the data reveal an increase in nationals from the United States & Canada and a coincidental decrease in the share of sta/uniFB00   from Europe (excluding Transition Countries).

Source: PeopleSoft HRMS.The IMF has worked to diversify the sources from which it recruits. Throughout 
the COVID-19 lockdown, the IMF has relied exclusively on virtual outreach and interviews, resulting in a 300 percent increase in recruitment missions. The Economist Program has seen a signiﬁ  cant increase in the number of virtual outreach sessions, especially to universities within URR regions. In addition, a more proactive approach was deployed to source candidates from URRs for the mid-career process. As shown in Figure 5, some slight progress has been made—at the end of FY 2021, 3 percent of sta/uniFB00   with PhDs obtained their degrees from URR universities—up from 2 percent at the end of FY 2019 and 8 percent from universities in Other Regions—up from 7 percent. At the same time, 10 percent of sta/uniFB00   from Other Western Hemisphere and SSA have PhDs from universities in URR or Other countries. Outreach and sourcing activities often bear fruit only after several years. The IMF anticipates continued progress in the years ahead but will seek to maintain the momentum and continue proactive outreach to and sourcing from universities and talent pools in lesser-represented regions and countries.

Progress Toward FY 2025 
Diversity Benchmarks
The status at the end of FY 2021 against the FY 2025 benchmarks reveals progress 
in ﬁ  ve of the eight indicators, including on A9–A14/A15 sta/uniFB00   from URRs. Despite this progress, more e/uniFB00  orts are needed, speciﬁ  cally for women and MENA+ nationals at the individual contributor level and URR sta/uniFB00   at the managerial level (Table 2). There was a slight decrease in the percentage share of representation for two of the targets, although absolute numbers have increased, and there was no change for one of the benchmarks (see arrows in the last column).  A ﬁ  ve-year trend for the benchmarks and other regional groupings can be found in Annex 3, Table 1.
A more precise capture of the IMF’s broader diversity emerges when incorpo-
rating sta/uniFB00   with self-declared secondary nationalities. Including sta/uniFB00   who have self-declared a secondary nationality from one of the URRs reveals a signiﬁ  cant jump in representation. More speciﬁ  cally, at the individual contributor level, for the MENA+ region the di/uniFB00  erence is +1.7 percentage points (an additional 31 sta/uniFB00   members) and for sub-Saharan Africa an increase of 0.8 percentage points (14 sta/uniFB00   members), with a similar impact for managerial roles.
The picture for the share of women at di/uniFB00  erent levels of the organization is mixed. 
Since the new benchmarks were introduced in July 2020, the overall number of women in the individual contributor grades (A9–A14/15) has increased slightly, but the percentage share has marginally decreased. The share of women in mana-gerial roles (A14/A15–B5) increased 1.6 percentage points to 34.5 percent in the last ﬁ  scal year, with an even stronger performance at the most senior levels (B4 and B5). These gains reﬂ  ect the continued e/uniFB00  orts by management to rebalance gender in managerial roles.
Finally, the IMF continues to encourage the Executive Board to lead by example. 
The IMF recognizes the commitment to promote gender diversity and the e/uniFB00  orts being undertaken by the Executive Board’s Working Group on Gender Diversity to raise awareness of the beneﬁ  ts and importance of gender diversity. Since the 2019 D&I Report and at the time of writing, the number of female Executive Directors has increased from three at the end of FY 2019 to four/uni003B however, women still represent only 17 percent of Executive Directors. When Alternate Executive Directors are added, the share of women is 15 percent (8 of 52) with one Executive 
Director vacancy.

Economicst Program (EP) cohorts are selected on a yearly cycle, with each cohort starting in September.Despite some progress to increase educational diversity, challenges remain. The Economist Program (EP), which is the primary intake for PhD graduates, has seen limited progress on the educational diversity of its cohorts over time. The previous trend of the vast majority of EP hires coming from US and UK universities continues, with the share increasing from 62.5 percent in 2017 to 69 percent in 2021. On the other hand, EP recruits with degrees from universities in Other Regions has increased by 2 percentage points (Figure 6).

 At the individual 
contributor level, the share of nationals for all three underrepresented regions has increased, with the representation of East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa remaining above the target.
 For managerial roles, the 
share of nationals from sub-Saharan Africa has grown slightly, and good progress in the share of women continues.
 The share of women at 
individual contributor level, however, has decreased slightly.
 The share of URR nationals 
in managerial roles has increased slightly but is well below the target.
A full picture of the diversity of the IMF’s population is critical. It is equally critical to understand the three factors that contribute to the makeup of the population: inﬂ  ow (recruitment), career progression (promotion), and outﬂ  ow (separation). These are addressed in the next three sections, with speciﬁ  c challenges high-lighted to draw attention to where the focus should be placed in the coming three to four years to achieve the FY 2025 benchmarks.

(surveillance, lending, capacity development) and also respond to emerging priorities (climate change, digital money, macro-ﬁ  nancial surveillance, fragile and conﬂ  ict-a/uniFB00  ected states, inclusive growth, and gender), area of specialization will become an important component in diversifying the educational and skills backgrounds of sta/uniFB00  . This section sets out high-level key data related to trends in external recruitment.
The IMF has encountered uneven success in its diversity recruitment, similar to 
trends in achieving diversity benchmarks. At the individual contributor level, the IMF has recruited su/uniFB03   cient nationals from East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to meet objectives/uni003B however, considerable struggles remain in recruiting from the MENA+ region and women into professional roles. Similarly, the low share of women and URR nationals hired into managerial roles is insu/uniFB03   cient to contribute to the achievement of the FY 2025 Benchmarks.
In FY 2021, 46 percent of external hires were sta/uniFB00  , and 54 percent were contrac-
tual employees. As in previous years, the vast majority (67 percent) of all hires were into the A9–A15 or equivalent Professional (P) category for contractual employees. In the Support category (S for contractuals and A1–A8 for sta/uniFB00  ), a much higher ratio of contractual employees is being hired (1 in 2 vs. 1 in 8 sta/uniFB00  ). This reﬂ  ects the high number of Research Assistants hired as contractual employees. Managerial roles accounted for 4 percent of all external recruitments (Figure 7)./T_h  e IMF uses recruitment as its main tool to increase staﬀ   diversity. While adhering to the aim of 
recruiting the highest-quali/f_i  ed candidates, it is strategically important to consider diversity in terms of gender, regional representation, as well as educational and professional background.
2020–2021 Report 9
Trends
The 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group recommended reducing the 
number of recruitment targets. For the period leading up to the end of FY 2025, the 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group proposed having only two external recruitment targets—one for women (50 percent) and the other for nationals from MENA+ (10 percent), both for roles in grades A9–A15 (individual contributors), so as to focus the IMF’s recruitment e/uniFB00  orts on the main challenges.
Since the last report, the IMF has made some progress in increasing the share 
of MENA+ nationals recruited, but it remains below target and continues to lag behind in the share of women hired, which averaged 36.5 percent over the ﬁ  ve years to the end of FY 2021 (Figure 8). If these trends continue, the cumulative impact may result in longer-term consequences on diversity in leadership roles. Together with diversifying recruits into managerial roles, increasing the share of women and MENA+ nationals into the individual contributor category should be given priority in the coming years.
Over the last ﬁ  ve years, women accounted for approximately 77 percent of hires 
in sta/uniFB00   grades A1–A8 and approximately 65 percent of contractual Support (S). These are slight increases compared to the ﬁ  ve-year averages reported in 2019 and were driven, in the case of sta/uniFB00   positions, by spikes in FY 2020 and FY 2021. The IMF is slightly more successful in recruiting women as contractual employees than as sta/uniFB00   into the P/A9–A15 levels (38 percent vs. 36 percent average over ﬁ  ve years, respectively). Greater variations are seen in external recruitments into managerial roles due to the low number of hires each year. Figure 9 depicts the ﬁ  ve-year trend in recruitment of women into the di/uniFB00  erent grade groups. Figure 8. Share of A9–A15 Staﬀ   Recruitment

Mid-Career Fungible Economists
Mid-career recruitment, which accounts for more than half of the IMF’s hires of 
“fungible” macroeconomists,10 has become an important avenue for bringing 
in diverse economists. Starting in 2018, the mid-career recruitment process has gone through a fundamental change. It has focused more on sourcing candidates from URRs, is run at set times during the year and is governed by the Economist Committee—the same committee that oversees the Economist Program.
Recruitment of mid-career fungible economists from URRs has improved. Since 
the changes were implemented, except for FY 2019, the share of candidates hired from URRs has risen considerably, reaching over 50 percent in three of the ﬁ  ve reference years. Men from URRs, however, have far outpaced women from URRs. More generally, the share of women in the mid-career pipeline remains well below the 50 percent overall recruitment target (Figure 12).
10 “Fungible economists” bring a variety of previous work experiences, often in areas of emerging focus for the 
IMF (climate change, for example). Mid-career hires undergo a competitive hiring process that includes a written 
assessment, preliminary interview, a mid-career panel interview, and Economist Committee clearance. They are then placed into a pipeline from which departments can select them.

DDC = Deputy Division Chief.Recruitments by career stream (Figure 10, panel 2), show a wide gender gap for Economists and gender balance for the Specialized Career Stream. On average over the last ﬁ  ve years, economists represented almost 65 percent of hires into the A9–B5 levels, with female economists averaging a third of economist hires. The share of male economists hired from URRs has been increasing steadily and reached 28 percent in FY 2021, 4 percentage points higher than the ﬁ  ve-year average (Figure 10, panel 3). On the other hand, the share of female economists recruited from URRs has remained constant. Among new hires, 36 percent were hired into Specialized Career (SCS) roles. Of these, slightly more than half were women, with an increase in the number of women from URRs hired in the last two years (Figure 10, panel 4).
The hiring of sta/uniFB00   from URRs into managerial roles, particularly women, remains 
a considerable challenge. Over the last ﬁ  ve years, 59 percent of managers hired externally were men, of which one in ﬁ  ve were from URRs. Of the 24 women hired, three (12.5 percent) were from URRs—only 5 percent of external managerial recruitments (Figure 11).

Economist Program
Like the mid-career process, recruitment into the Economist Program is central-
ized and continues to deliver better diversity results than individual hiring. In the ﬁ  ve cohorts from 2017 to 2021, the share of women recruited via the Economist Program has generally been more than 40 percent (Figure 13, panel 1), higher than the share of women graduating with PhDs in economics (between 30 and 35 percent). At slightly more than 36 percent, the share of URR nationals hired through this program has exceeded the 30 percent representation target set out in the Institutional Goals. Of the three underrepresented regions, nationals from East Asia were hired in higher numbers (Figure 13, panel 2). Continuing to increase the share of women and URR nationals recruited through this program will contribute to the pipeline of candidates for managerial roles in the long term.

Future Hiring Space
The vast majority of IMF hires over the next three years will likely be at the A9–B5 levels. Workforce planning will inform the exact mix of external and internal hires as well as the employment type (Economist Program vs. mid-career) and contract type (sta/uniFB00   vs. contractual). Internal mobility will also create opportunities for sta/uniFB00   to beneﬁ  t from career development and progression.Facing Remaining 
Recruitment Challenges
As mentioned above, the IMF has made progress, but some challenges remain. 
Considering the elements and challenges presented in this Recruitment section, the following areas need to be prioritized to achieve the FY 2025 Benchmarks:
1. increase the share of women into individual contributor roles
2. increase the share of MENA+ nationals into individual contributor roles
3. increase the share of women recruited into managerial roles
4. increase the share of URR nationals in managerial roles

As noted, few managers at the IMF are hired externally. /T_h  e policy of sourcing managers internally allows the IMF to grow its existing talent and provide career advancement opportunities. /T_h  is section presents recent trends in promotion rates in both the Economist and Specialized Career Streams.
Trends for Economists
The average rate of promotion from A14 to A15 over the last ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nancial years 
(FY 2017 to FY 2021) is 4.1 percent. When comparing rates of promotion among di/uniFB00  erent regions (Figure 14, panel 1), nationals from sub-Saharan Africa have been promoted at a rate higher than the IMF average, which is a positive change compared to the ﬁ  ve years leading up to the end of FY 2019. For sta/uniFB00   from Asia (excluding East Asia), the rate of promotions is more than double the average, and sta/uniFB00   from many other regions are being promoted at rates similar to or above the IMF average, with the notable exception of Other Western Hemisphere.
IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 14
In the ﬁ  ve years leading up to the end of FY 2021, women have seen a higher 
average rate of promotion from A14 to A15 than men. For women from URRs, the average rate of promotion from A14 to A15 has increased by 1.2 percentage points to 4.5 percent (compared to the last reporting period FY 2015 to FY 2019) (Figure 14, panel 2). Women from Other Regions continue to be promoted at a rate above the IMF average. Even with higher rates for women, men from Other Regions are being promoted at a similar rate to the IMF average, though men from URRs were promoted at a rate slightly below the IMF average in the last 5 years.
When looking at promotions from A15 to B1, the average rate for two regions 
is signiﬁ  cantly above the IMF average of 7 percent. Sta/uniFB00   from MENA+ and Asia (excluding East Asia), with average rates of 13.9 and 10 percent, respectively, have been promoted at much higher rates than that of other groups (Figure 15, panel 1). The rates of promotion for other groups have remained similar to the previous reporting period, with some small variances. More importantly, while the overall promotion rates are generally low (and di/uniFB00  erences are correspondingly “small”), it is important to understand the magnitude of these “small” di/uniFB00  erences. For instance, among Other Western Hemisphere, one in thirty sta/uniFB00   is promoted while the overall IMF average is one in fourteen. For comparison, among MENA+ nationals, one in seven sta/uniFB00   is promoted.
The average rate of promotion for women from URRs into B-level positions is 
much higher than during the previous reporting period but remains below the IMF average. In the period FY 2017 to FY 2021, the average promotion rate for women from URRs to B-level positions was 5.7 percent - an increase from 2 percent during FY 2015 to FY 2019 (Figure 15, panel 2). The ﬁ  ve-year average rate of promotion for men from Other Regions has increased to 6.3 percent from 5.1 percent. Similar to promotions from A14 to A15, the higher-than-average rate of promotions from A15 to B1 for women is driven by the promotion of women from Other Regions.Figure 15.

The IMF ﬁ  ve-year average rate of promotion for SCS sta/uniFB00   from A14 and A15 to B-level is 5.2 percent, compared to 3.8 percent in the previous reporting period. Half the regions, including Europe (excluding Transition Countries), MENA+, and East Asia, show average rates of promotion higher than the overall IMF average (Figure 16, panel 1). Similar to economists, sta/uniFB00   from MENA+ have beneﬁ  ted more from promotions than other regional groups, with the average rate jumping from 6.5 percent for FY 2015 to FY 2019 to 13.3 percent for FY 2017 to FY 2021. The average rate of promotion for sta/uniFB00   from Other Western Hemisphere remains below the average. Importantly, since FY 2015 (the start of the previous reporting period), the IMF has seen no promotions of nationals from sub-Saharan Africa for SCS sta/uniFB00  .Women from URRs have been promoted at a rate 1 percentage point higher than the IMF average. The average rate for men from Other Regions (3) is also above the average (Figure 16, panel 2)/uni003B whereas those for women from Other Regions and men from URRs are slightly below the average.
The 2019 D&I Report provided data on promotion rates from the A1–A8 grade 
group to A9 and above. Despite the low number and rate of such promotions, continued reporting on this group of sta/uniFB00   is important. Table 3 provides an over-view for the period FY 2017 to FY 2021. On an average annual population of 428, an average of 10 promotions occurred each year, though none took place in FY 2020 and only one in FY 2021, bringing the average down for the entire period. When comparing the average rates of promotion by gender and region (Figure 17), men from URRs have been promoted at a higher rate than the average. All other groups are in line with the IMF average.

Areas of Focus to Address Promotion Challenges
Ensuring a robust diverse pipeline for leadership roles and upholding a policy of growing talent will require some targeted measures in the coming years. The primary areas of focus should be on providing equitable opportunities for sta/uniFB00   development and strengthening the pipeline of eligible sta/uniFB00   for them to be in a position to:
1. Increase the rate of promotion into managerial roles for women economists 
from URRs.
2. Increase the rate of promotion from A14 to A15 for economists from sub-Saharan Africa, MENA+, East Asia, and the Transition Countries.
3. Increase the rates of promotion into managerial roles for sta/uniFB00   from sub-Saharan Africa and Other Western Hemisphere in the Specialized Career Streams.Table 3. A1–A8 to A9 and above Rate of Promotion,

2020–2021 Report 17
Along with external recruitment and promotions, separations are the third factor impacting diversity. 
/T_h  is section analyzes the /f_i  ve-year trends in overall resignations, retirements, and other separations.
Separations from the IMF remain generally low, although the Fund is starting to 
see an uptick in the number of retirements as foreseen in the 2019 D&I Report. The share of retirements is highest for A9-A15 sta/uniFB00  , in line with their overall population. The average rate of resignations over the last ﬁ  ve years is 1.5 percent. Women from Other Regions and men from URRs are resigning at slightly higher rates than the IMF average.
Trends
In the ﬁ  ve years leading up to the end of FY 2021, the total number of separa-tions has averaged roughly 5 percent of sta/uniFB00  . Separations ranged from a low of 132 in FY 2018 to a high of 162 in FY 2017, with FY 2021 also seeing an increase to 160 (Figure 18, panel 1). In each year, the highest share of separations was due to retirements (on average 60 percent), followed by voluntary resignations (on average 27 percent), and ﬁ  nally other separations (on average 13 percent). In FY 2021, retirements accounted for more than two-thirds (67.5 percent) of separations.Figure 18. Types of Separation for Staﬀ

The highest number of separations has occurred at grades A9–15 (reﬂ  ecting their 
higher share of sta/uniFB00  ). Among this group, there was an average of 56 percent retirements, 30 percent voluntary resignations, and 14 percent other separations (Figure 18, panel 2). In FY 2021, the share of retirements in this grade group rose to 64 percent. Similar patterns are also observed for the other two smaller grade groups, B1–B5 and A1–A8.When looking at voluntary resignations, the average rate for FY 2017 to FY 2021 is 1.5 percent. Men from URRs and women from Other Regions continue to resign at a slightly higher rate than the average. Women from URRs resign at a considerably lower rate (Figure 19, panel 1). These data are similar to the previous reporting period, with no qualitative change in the reported pattern.

2020–2021 Report 19
/T_h  e 2019 D&I Report emphasized that achieving numerical diversity targets is important and 
stressed that the IMF must also focus on creating a more inclusive work environment. 
One of the IMF’s core values is inclusion, and its workforce diversity can only be 
leveraged to better serve the membership and produce creative and innovative solutions if employees feel they are respected, that their opinions are valued, and that they operate in a safe environment.
11 The IMF also needs to ensure 
that everyone is given equitable opportunities to speak, shine, and engage in meaningful ways, and that by doing so their contributions are acknowledged and rewarded fairly. This section provides a summary of the IMF’s organization-wide e/uniFB00  orts to foster a more inclusive environment.
11  See broader evidence in McKinsey & Company (2018) - https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/
people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity  on the business case for 
diversity and inclusion.Racial Equity
Racial equity and justice are now squarely on the IMF’s D&I agenda. The numerous well-publicized killings of black people by law enforcement o/uniFB03   cers in the United States, the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in many countries following the events in May 2020, and the increasing hostility toward Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic spurred the IMF’s Management and sta/uniFB00   into action to better understand race in the workplace and reiterate the commitment to the safety and equitable treatment of all sta/uniFB00   regardless of their race or identity.
IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 20
Box 1. Racial Equity Initiatives and Actions
Management reemphasized its zero tolerance for discrimination, bullying, 
and harassment. The IMF’s Managing Director (MD) and Deputy Managing Directors (DMDs) reached out to black employees and those from URRs to listen to the challenges they face at the IMF and committed to taking action to ensure any potential inequities are being addressed. The commitments included initiatives to be implemented in the short term: information and awareness campaigns, leveraging the Diversity Reference Group (DRG) community, and increased transparency on the allocation of annual perfor-mance review (APR) ratings and promotions, as well as more medium-term objectives such as exploring how to gather reliable quantitative and quali-tative data, a review of the mandate and process of the Review Committee, giving the Inclusion and Diversity Council (I&D Council) a more robust mandate, and actions arising from a D&I Survey.Black employees mobilized to create learning opportunities and propose concrete initiatives. A new Employee Resource Group (ERG), the Network of Black Sta/uniFB00  , was created and met regularly with Management and the D&I O/uniFB03   ce. ERG members’ practical proposals as to measures the IMF could take to address internal racial equity and justice have resulted in the hiring of a Senior Race Expert and the creation of a Racial Equity and Justice Advisory Group. The Advisory Group, comprised of members from within and outside the IMF, is tasked with providing advice, recommendations, and guidance on redressing racial inequity and its consequences within the IMF and will deliver a report outlining a broad strategy and recommended actions in early FY 2023. 
Diversity Resource Groups (DRGs) and regional groups came together to create the Racial Justice and Equity Speaker Series. The aim of this series is to provide learning opportunities for employees to understand the history of race in the United States, the impact of racial inequity on people of color, and how organizations can foster greater inclusion and equity. Since June 2020, eight events have taken place, many attended by more than 350 partic-ipants each, and the IMF Library created an Anti-Racism Resource Center to provide employees with materials on the topic.Departmental management teams a/uniFB03   rmed their support to racially diverse colleagues. Many held townhall meetings/uni003B provided safe spaces for employees to discuss their individual and collective challenges, both within and outside the IMF/uni003B o/uniFB00  ered resources/uni003B and worked actively with their DRGs to provide occasions to improve knowledge around racial justice and equity.
These collective e/uniFB00  orts have led to broad acceptance that racial equity needs more prominence within the IMF. In addition to the work of the Advisory Group mentioned above, the D&I O/uniFB03   ce has been working with key stakeholders on a voluntary self-identiﬁ  cation survey, which will include race/ethnicity, to gain a better view of the share of sta/uniFB00   of di/uniFB00  erent racial backgrounds in the IMF. These data, complemented by the results of a D&I Survey will provide valuable insights and allow better targeting of IMF initiatives. 
2020–2021 Report 21
Sponsorship Program
As a key recommendation from the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality 
(EDGE) recertiﬁ  cation in 2019, the IMF established a formal Sponsorship Program. It will allow strong-performing individuals from underrepresented groups to be supported by a senior manager (Sponsor) who has knowledge of their work and can vouch/advocate for equity in treatment in terms of access to senior leaders, career-enabling assignments, career development, and career advancement opportunities. Sponsorship currently exists informally, but a formal corporate program will help mitigate the potential bias that stems from existing arrange-ments and beneﬁ  t a wider pool of sta/uniFB00  . In the longer term, the program should also bring about greater progress toward the benchmarks.
While EDGE recommended a Sponsorship Program for women, the IMF’s pilot 
program focuses on nationals from URRs. The IMF’s data show that URR nationals do not have easy access to career-enabling assignments and have not beneﬁ  ted from career advancement at the same rate as other regional groups. Sta/uniFB00   from URRs also shared that they often lack networks and role models because of the low number of their compatriots in managerial roles.
The pilot program’s objective is to address this low representation of URRs in key 
pipelines for managerial roles and in managerial roles themselves. Although not the goal of the IMF’s program, research
12 shows that sponsorship may result in 
higher rates of promotion for the targeted groups. It also allows the organization to beneﬁ  t from the contributions of a broader range of talent and “hidden gems,” who can contribute in meaningful ways. Greater engagement and career satis-faction of the sponsored individuals may also contribute to greater retention of talent, helping build the relevant pipelines.
The initial cohort for the pilot program consists of 26 pairings. Senior Managers 
were asked to volunteer as Sponsors, whereas Participants (those being sponsored) were put forward by departments based on a number of criteria, including grade level, track record of good performance, openness to feedback and coaching, evidence of being goal oriented, interest in working in other

Sponsors and Participants were matched based on areas of work and work history, with careful attention being paid to ensuring no direct line of reporting between each pair.
Sponsors and Participants have been provided with training. As the concept 
of formal Sponsorship is new to the IMF, it engaged a leading industry vendor to deliver workshops and provide tips and tools for success. The workshops, complemented by a playbook, addressed the following areas:
1. Di/uniFB00  erences among mentoring/coaching/sponsorship
2. Sponsor and Participant roles and responsibilities
3. The importance of relationship capital
4. Key activities and actions for a successful sponsorship relationship
5. Building chemistry
The D&I O/uniFB03   ce will accompany the cohort throughout the two-year pilot period. 
Regular check-ins are planned to gather feedback and address questions and concerns. In addition, the D&I O/uniFB03   ce will facilitate peer meetings to allow each group, Sponsors and Participants separately, to share best practices and raise challenges in a safe environment. A survey will be conducted in early FY 2023 to take the pulse and course adjust if needed.
Finally, the IMF will measure success and apply learnings from the pilot to open 
a fully-ﬂ  edged program targeting a much wider audience. A set of perfor-mance indicators and measurements to assess the success of the pilot are being ﬁ  nalized. The aim is to take lessons learned from the two-year pilot and adapt the model, where necessary, prior to extending the roll out to a broader set of Participants. Given that the number of sta/uniFB00   put forward for the initial pilot exceeded the number of available slots, the IMF may launch a second cohort, in FY 2023, if feedback after the initial 9- to 12-month period is positive.

Disabilities
In the 2019 Report, the IMF committed to broaden the scope of its D&I activities 
to encompass more underrepresented groups. In December 2006 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities .
13 The IMF aims to gradually align, as much as possible, with this 
Convention. It embarked on this journey in FY 2021 and aims to continue making progress over the next several years. The D&I O/uniFB03   ce is engaging with key stake-holders to implement the necessary changes.
The IMF has relaunched its former Working Group on People with Disabilities. 
The aim of this interdepartmental Working Group is to review the IMF’s current disability-related policies and practices and make proposals on potential improvements. The group will benchmark against similar organizations and the private sector to identify best practices for implementation.
The D&I O/uniFB03   ce worked with sta/uniFB00   to create an Employee Resource Group dedi-
cated to employees with disabilities and those who care for dependents with disabilities. The aim of this group is to provide an a/uniFB03   nity group, similar to those for other communities in the IMF, and to leverage its knowledge and experiences to ensure that policies, practices, IT tools, buildings, social media, and the like are accessible for all.
The IMF is lagging signiﬁ  cantly behind its peers in embracing and actively 
pursuing disability as a diversity priority. Many have in place clear policies and centralized budgets for reasonable accommodations, have implemented tools to make their internal and external websites accessible, and are increasing their e/uniFB00  orts to recruit people who identify as having a disability. The IMF is seeking to become current, meet minimum standards of accessibility, and increase its e/uniFB00  orts to accommodate and hire people with disabilities.
13 Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities - 
https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.htmlDiversity and Inclusion Training
Mandatory trainings on unconscious bias and workplace harassment have been in place since 2018. These trainings, o/uniFB00  ered respectively by the D&I and Ethics O/uniFB03   ces, were updated in 2021 to provide employees with more recent and engaging content. All o/uniFB00  erings are through e-learning, allowing employees to take them at convenient times and at their own pace within a deﬁ  ned deadline. These courses complement other diversity-related training such as Inclusive Interviewing Skills, components included in the Leadership Development Program o/uniFB00  erings and general management training courses related to perfor-mance management, communication, and managing teams. In addition, in response to requests from sta/uniFB00   and managers, courses on racial equity and mental health are currently being tested, launching by the end of FY 2022.
Use of Preferred Pronouns
Employees may use their preferred pronouns in their IMF signature on a volun-tary basis. In recognition of the growing number of people who do not identify as either male or female and following a successful IMF GLOBE (Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Employees)
14 event in May 2020 on the use of appropriate pronouns, 
CSF/Creative, with the support of the D&I O/uniFB03   ce and Management, agreed that sta/uniFB00   could indicate their preferred pronouns in their o/uniFB03   cial IMF signature (see example). The use of correct pronouns is a sign of respect for and accep-tance of sta/uniFB00  ’s di/uniFB00  erent identities generally, but especially those within the LGBTQ+ community. It goes some way to enabling sta/uniFB00   to bring another aspect of their identities to work – an important component of fostering an inclusive work environment.

Key partners for the D&I team are the departmental Diversity Resource Groups (DRGs) and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) or sta/uniFB00   clubs.

Box 2. IMF Staﬀ   Diversity and Inclusion Intiatives
Talks by Charitable Organizations
To present a culture that is compassionate, inclusive, and empathetic to the 
needs of others, one IMF DRG invited four nonproﬁ  t charitable organiza-tions to present their role and how they impact quality of life for people who are facing challenges. To build solidarity in the department, sta/uniFB00   were also provided with information about volunteering opportunities and ways they could contribute.Safe Space to Share Tough Experiences
As a demonstration of support for colleagues, a DRG from one IMF depart-
ment set up informal sessions and discussion fora on racial equity in which sta/uniFB00   were given the space to share their experiences of racism and racial equity following a departmentwide survey on the same issue.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Assessment
Supported by their department’s managers, another IMF DRG conducted a 
department-wide survey to assess sta/uniFB00   perceptions of D&I issues. The survey was followed by thematic listening circles at which sta/uniFB00   could discuss the concerns raised. Racial Inclusion, Policymaking, and Economic Outcomes
Another sta/uniFB00   group organized a panel discussion between IMF sta/uniFB00   and 
external experts to raise awareness about the disproportionate economic and health e/uniFB00  ects of COVID-19 on racial minorities.
Advances Inclusion and Cohesion
Chinese sta/uniFB00   members held a virtual Lunar New Year gathering and farewell 
parties and started IMF Chinese Sta/uniFB00   Association (CSA) newsletters to share work and life achievements. In addition, CSA leadership sought members’ input on their career development challenges and discussed ways in which they could be overcome.Advances Inclusion and/uni00A0Equity
IMF GLOBE, which supports gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender 
employees, worked with the D&I O/uniFB03   ce to design the D&I Survey LGBTQ+ inclusive and established a Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity (SOGI) Analytical Working Group, which seeks to explore and understand the added value of nondiscriminatory policies toward LGBTQ+ populations to promote inclusive policy design.
/T_h  e 2019 Diversity and Inclusion Report identi/f_i  ed accountability as a primary 
challenge the IMF faced in achieving its diversity objectives.
This ﬁ  nding was also supported by the 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working 
Group, which in its Report of November 2020 indicated “For the e/uniFB00  orts promoted by HRD and D&I O/uniFB03   ce to succeed, they have to be owned by departments and have buy-in from all managers.”
15 Recognizing the need to strengthen account-
ability for D&I results, the IMF has rolled out several initiatives in the last two years. Signiﬁ  cant e/uniFB00  orts have been deployed to improve accountability IMF-wide, including at the departmental, and individual manager levels, a summary of which follows. More generally, to keep the IMF on track, a Three-Year Framework was developed and presented to Management. Regular updates are provided on the status of initiatives against the timeline set out in the Framework. As many of the initiatives are ongoing, assessing their impact will be possible only in the medium to long term.
Signaling from the Highest Level
Management rea/uniFB03   rmed its commitment to Diversity & Inclusion. In September 2020, a new Diversity and Inclusion Statement
16 was published on the IMF 
external website. The statement rea/uniFB03   rmed that “The strength of the Fund comes from its talented and diverse employees” and clariﬁ  ed that each individual is responsible for contributing to D&I at the IMF. The statement also sets out a number of commitments, such as attracting, retaining, and developing diverse talent/uni003B enforcing management accountability/uni003B and overcoming explicit and implicit biases.

16 Diversity and Inclusion statement - https://www.imf.org/external/hrd/diversity.htmSetting the FY 2025 Benchmarks
The 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group was constituted in September 2019 and completed its work in June 2020. The remit of the Working Group was to assess progress against the 2020 Diversity Benchmarks, formulate the new 2025 Benchmarks, and recommend policy solutions, which were endorsed by Management and presented to the IMF’s Executive Board. In setting the FY 2025 Benchmarks, the Working Group underscored that ambition needs to strike a balance with realism and equity, and identiﬁ  ed four anchors: Equitable, Principled, Inclusive, and Clear (EPIC):
• Equitable: aiming for gender balance
• Principled: balanced shares of URR based on quota & IMF business
• Inclusive: a more holistic approach wherein everybody counts (contractual 
employees and A1-A8)
• Clear: simpliﬁ  ed framework
To achieve the benchmarks, the Working Group also recommended initiatives 
concerning policies and practices. These were grouped into several topical areas: attracting diverse sta/uniFB00  /uni003B using incentives, ownership, and accountability/uni003B empha-sizing retention and career progression/uni003B and developing inclusion metrics and benchmarks. Some of the recommendations overlapped with existing or planned initiatives/uni003B others were new.
2020–2021 Report 25
Departmental Diversity and Inclusion 
Action Plans
Without accountability at the departmental level, the IMF cannot achieve its 
D&I objectives. In November 2020, with the support of the I&D Council, the D&I O/uniFB03   ce rolled out Departmental D&I Action Plans in which Heads of Departments (HoDs) committed to high-level actions and more tangible initiatives. The plans provide departments with an overview of the diverse composition of their teams (stock) as well as the ﬂ  ow (external recruitments).
The full impact of the departmental D&I action plans can be appropriately 
measured only after a few years. An initial review at the end of FY 2021, however, shows that:
• Implementation of concrete departmental D&I Action Plans has been a 
positive step in the IMF’s D&I journey as it has raised more awareness around challenges within individual departments.
• Departments have set SMART objectives with concrete actions/initiatives to increase diversity in their teams and monitor diversity in key career develop-ment processes.
• Departments are thinking more carefully and being more intentional about expanding sourcing to reach previously untapped candidate pools.
• Many departments have been deﬁ  ning “career-enabling” assignments.
Accountability Framework
For many years the IMF Accountability Framework (AF) has been the primary means of holding Heads of Departments accountable for achieving business results. The AF comprises a mix of business and people management indi-cators against which HoDs are evaluated and rewarded. Management meets twice yearly with each HoD to assess progress against the AF objectives and to course-adjust priorities as needed. In the past, the discussions have primarily focused on business results—those related to key achievements related to serving the membership or key business processes. In December 2020, a clear signal emerged as to the importance Management attributes to people manage-ment, including diversity and inclusion. The agenda inverted the order of the discussions/uni003B D&I and other human resource indicators were reviewed before business-speciﬁ  c results. This shift has been a signiﬁ  cant one in the culture of performance management for senior managers.Diversity and Inclusion Survey
In March 2021, HRD launched a D&I Survey. The survey asked sta/uniFB00   (including contractual employees) to voluntarily self-identify across di/uniFB00  erent diversity dimensions—a ﬁ  rst step in collecting broader diversity data—and sought sta/uniFB00   perceptions and experiences at the IMF related to belonging, inclusion, their managers, training & leadership development, and discrimination and harass-ment. The response rate of 43 percent compares favorably with similar surveys and allowed the team to extract valuable insights. This survey sets a benchmark against which the IMF will be able to measure progress in the coming years and hold managers accountable for creating a more inclusive, equitable, and safe working environment.
The survey highlighted several issues of signiﬁ  cant concern. More speciﬁ  cally, 
some sta/uniFB00   reported not feeling valued or respected due to their identity/uni003B experi-encing and witnessing unconscious bias, discrimination, and harassment/uni003B being reluctant to report for fear of retaliation/uni003B or lacking trust in the IMF’s safeguarding mechanisms. On a positive note, a vast majority of respondents reported that their manager (in this case direct supervisor) creates a safe and trusting work environment for all team members, regardless of their identity.
The Management Team, including Heads of Departments, is strongly committed 
to addressing the challenges identiﬁ  ed. A plan of immediate next steps has been identiﬁ  ed, with the aim of engaging in a bottom-up exercise to solicit more medi-um-term and sustainable actions.
IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 26
/T_h  e strategic importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion is becoming increasingly accepted 
as a business priority that will help the IMF better serve its membership. /T_h  e D&I sphere is ever evolving: addressing its related challenges is and will be a continuous journey. In the two years since the last report, while maintaining a keen focus on gender and regional representation, the IMF has embarked on a path to broaden the scope of diversity dimensions included in its portfolio and made strides to improve inclusiveness and strengthen accountability for achieving results.
The IMF must keep in step with the evolving D&I landscape and ensure that, at 
minimum, it meets the same standards it is asking of its stakeholders. In addition to continuing to pay close attention to two main priorities for hiring and sta/uniFB00   development—gender and underrepresented regions—the IMF needs to take a more granular look at what it has actually achieved so far. For example, there has been progress in the share of women in managerial roles, but disparities exist among the women who have beneﬁ  ted from these e/uniFB00  orts. The topic of inter-sectionality, the conﬂ  uence of di/uniFB00  erent diversity dimensions such as gender and race or race and sexual orientation, is becoming more prominent. In future, it will become more important to look at the intersections of a broader set of diversity dimensions to identify and address unintended gaps that have emerged.
The D&I Survey revealed that very few employees are aware of what the IMF does 
to accommodate people who identify as having a disability. In the next two years it proposes to raise the visibility of this important diversity dimension by engaging with its existing community of colleagues and external parties to evaluate current policies and accommodation practices, with a view to better enabling not only current employees, but also potential candidates, reassuring them that the IMF will address their reasonable accommodation needs, if hired.
To achieve benchmarks, the IMF will focus its e/uniFB00  orts on external recruitment and 
developing existing talent so that they are ready to take on managerial roles. More speciﬁ  cally, the IMF will leverage the additional hiring space provided by the business priority areas—climate change, gender inclusion, digital ﬁ  nance, and closer engagement with fragile and low-income states—and the increase in sta/uniFB00   retirements. Table 4 sets out the recommended areas of focus and initiatives to be taken to address ongoing challenges.

Since 2017, HRD has regularly conducted a pay gap analysis. The pay gap analysis 
has been mainly focused on di/uniFB00  erences in pay by gender and underrepresented regions. In 2020, for the ﬁ  rst time, the analysis relied on newly collected survey data to include race. The framework used in the estimations of the pay gap is fairly standard (see below) and is largely based on that used for the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) certiﬁ  cation.
Gender pay gaps and pay equity more generally remain a hot topic for human 
resources discussions and policies. Traditionally, studies have largely focused on gender and tend to show signiﬁ  cant di/uniFB00  erences in remunerations that are hard to explain. At the same time, pay gap analyses have also become more sophis-ticated and have moved away from simple comparison of average pay across di/uniFB00  erent groups (e.g., men and women) and have sought to incorporate the main determinants of pay to pinpoint the e/uniFB00  ect of gender or race.
18 At the IMF, an early 
study found no major systematic gender pay di/uniFB00  erences based on data from 1999–2013
19.
As noted above, the IMF has been conducting more regular pay gap assessments since 2017, in the context of the EDGE certiﬁ  cation. To understand di/uniFB00  erences in pay across gender and other factors (such as race) a regression analysis focused on pay has been used. The standard framework used here allows one to assess whether the gender pay di/uniFB00  erences remain (a pay “gap”) after controlling for additional factors that could potentially a/uniFB00  ect internal salaries. The baseline esti-mated equation below follows EDGE’s standard regression form, which includes personal characteristics such as age, tenure, performance ratings and educational level, as well as job-related factors such as department type and career level.
The latest pay gap analysis is based on data for FY 2020 and looks at gender, 
region, and race.
20 The data used include salaries and other individual char-
acteristics of 2,800 IMF sta/uniFB00  , including age, tenure, nationality, or region, etc.

20 Due to the sample size, for this PGA an analysis was possible only for two groups, one Afro/Black and the second 
regrouping all other races/ethnicities.In addition, survey data were used to estimate the pay gap between sta/uniFB00   who self-identiﬁ  ed as Afro/Black and the non-Afro/Black group. The survey data cover only about 40 percent of the larger sample and relies on data provided by sta/uniFB00   on a voluntary basis.
The results from the pay gap analysis show relatively small di/uniFB00  erences in pay 
across gender and race. In the regressions considered, the combined e/uniFB00  ect of age, tenure,  educational level, years in grade, and grade level all have a positive and signiﬁ  cant impact on pay and explain most of the variation in sta/uniFB00   salaries (Annex Figure 1.1)/uni003B the same variables also explain most of the di/uniFB00  erences in pay across gender and race. The following ﬁ  ndings are robust to a number of empir-ical checks, and applying the same framework to FY 2019 and FY 2016 shows broadly similar results.ANNEX 1.

2020–2021 Report 31
In the case of gender, the results indicate that the pay gap is generally small, 
especially for economists (55 percent of IMF sta/uniFB00  ). In the sample, pay for women is about 3.8 percent lower than that for men, after controlling for the other factors previously mentioned. This overall gap is close to the +/–5 percent overall pay gap in similar industries and in line with EDGE speciﬁ  cations.  In the case of econ-omists, the di/uniFB00  erence across gender is only –0.9 percent, and it is not statistically signiﬁ  cant. On the other hand, the di/uniFB00  erences across gender are larger, –5.4 percent for women, when considering sta/uniFB00   in specialized career streams (which in turn might reﬂ  ect di/uniFB00  erent levels of the pay gap for a large number of distinct job functions).
In the case of URR the e/uniFB00  ects are also generally small. In the baseline estimations 
used to assess the gender pay gap, the inclusion of URR does not alter the main results but indicates a small negative pay gap for URRs (below 5 percent). More speciﬁ  cally, the estimated coe/uniFB03   cient on the URR variable indicates a pay gap of –1.8 percent (about half of gender coe/uniFB03   cient), and the coe/uniFB03   cient is statis-tically signiﬁ  cant at the 5 percent level. Interestingly, the coe/uniFB03   cient is larger than in previous analyses using FY 16 and FY 19 data, and this trend will continue to be monitored closely.
Finally, in the case of race, the analysis zoomed in on the pay gap between 
Afro/Black and the rest of the sample (all other groups). As noted earlier, the sample used in this case is about 40 percent of the sta/uniFB00   (about 1,200 observa-tions), based on the number of respondents to a question on race/ethnicity. In particular, the coe/uniFB03   cient on the Afro/Black variable is –0.3 percent, and it is not statistically signiﬁ  cant. Worth noting: some sta/uniFB00   perceive a large pay gap based 
on race—these views do not align with the analysis. Other factors, such as career progression, may be contributing to these perceptions.
21 Given that only 15 percent of sta/uniFB00   self-identiﬁ  ed as Afro/Black, no additional subgroups (e.g., Afro/Black econo-
mists) were analyzed with this framework owing to the rather small sample sizes.
