members are considered to be usable in IMF transactions for the duration of
that quarter, while all other currencies are considered unusable.
The IMF’s holdings of SDRs are a readily usable resource, but these hold-
ings account for only a small fraction of the IMF’s assets. The use of SDRs
held by the IMF is therefore not limited to the same extent as the use of its
currency holdings. The IMF periodically establishes a long-term target range
for the level of its SDR holdings, which guides the actual use of SDRs in
IMF transactions. Other factors affecting the level of the IMF’s holdings of
SDRs are discussed in Chapter III.
The IMF closely monitors its liquidity position. TableII.9 presents the
IMF’s financial resources and liquidity position as of April30, 2001.48 For
this purpose, the stock of usable resources is adjusted downward to take into
account amounts already committed to members under existing IMF
arrangements. A further downward adjustment is made to ensure that the
IMF retains at all times sufficient working balances of each of the currencies
of members included in the financial transactions plan. The resulting
amount of net uncommitted usable resources is in principle available to
meet new demand for IMF resources. In practice, however, the adequacy of
the IMF’s liquidity position must also take into account the existence of liq-
uid claims accumulated by its creditor members: reserve tranche positions
and any outstanding loans under the GAB and NAB. These are considered
liquid liabilities because they can be drawn at short notice in the event of
balance of payments need, akin to demand deposits in a commercial bank,
and are thus the first claim on IMF resources. The liquidity ratio ties these
two concepts together in a single measure of the IMF’s liquidity. Historically,
the liquidity ratio has never fallen below 25–30percent.
Financial Transactions Plan
The IMF manages its usable resources through a financial transactions
plan. This is the mechanism through which the IMF selects the members
whose currencies are to be used in IMF transactions and allocates the
financing of those transactions among members included in the plan. Both
currencies and SDRs are included in the financial transactions plan for
transfers (credits) from the IMF to borrowing members but only currencies

IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/liquid).
