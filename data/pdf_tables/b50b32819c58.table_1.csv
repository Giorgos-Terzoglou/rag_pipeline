currencies of borrowers or financially weak members, are considered unus-
able. Thus, a portion of the GRA’s pool of resources consists of currencies
that cannot be used, leaving the IMF’s effective lending capacity at about
half of total quotas.3
The IMF may also supplement its quota resources by borrowing and
through additions to its precautionary balances. These balances comprise
reserves in the GRA as well as resources that have been set aside in the first
Special Contingent Account (SCA-1) to protect against the risk of overdue
payments. These resources are not segregated from other resources of the
GRA and can therefore finance the extension of credit.
With its usable resources, the IMF provides financing to its member coun-
tries. Members “borrow” from the GRA under the IMF’s “credit tranche”
policies or under special policies or facilities.4 The credit tranches provide
financing for balance of payments need, arising from almost any cause,
whereas credits under other facilities deal with needs arising from specified
causes. Financial assistance is typically made available in installments that
are linked to the borrowing country’s observance of specific economic and
financial policy conditions that must be met before the next installment is
released. These conditions are agreed with the member under agreements
called “arrangements.” Members using IMF resources pay a market-based
rate of interest on their outstanding use of credit from the IMF.
A member’s financial position in the IMF is measured by the GRA’s hold-
ings of its currency relative to quota. Members draw on the IMF’s pool of
members’ currencies and SDRs through a purchase-repurchase mechanism
(Box II.1). A member obtaining resources from the IMF “purchases” either
SDRs or the currency of another member in exchange for an equivalent
amount (in SDR terms) of its own currency, and later reverses the transaction
3A member with usable currency pays in a usable currency whereas other members pay
only the reserve asset portion in usable currency. Any member may pay the reserve asset
portion in SDRs. Currencies are held by the IMF in depository accounts at members’ cen-
tral banks. Payment of the nonreserve asset portion of quota subscriptions is normally in
the form of promissory notes (nonnegotiable, non-interest-bearing securities) that are con-
verted into currency on demand.
4GRA credit is normally governed by the IMF’s general lending policies (also known as
“credit tranche” policies), as opposed to the special policies that apply to other types of
credit. Both sets of policies are discussed in the section “Credit Outstanding.” IMF credit
has traditionally been provided in “tranches” (segments), equivalent to 25 percent of
quota, as explained in the section “Credit Tranche Policies.” “Borrowing” is undertaken
through the purchase-repurchase mechanism, which is discussed in Box II.1.
