FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
General Terms and Conditions
Balance of Payments Need
Members using IMF resources must have a balance of payments need. A
borrowing member cannot use IMF resources in the absence of a represen-
tation of balance of payments need, and the extent of their use cannot
exceed that need. Borrowing usually takes place under an IMF arrange-
ment, which is similar to a conditional line of credit and is associated with
the implementation of an economic reform program in a member country.
The most common type of arrangement is a Stand-By Arrangement in the
credit tranches or an arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF).11 Such arrangements can be approved on the basis of a prospective
balance of payments need, although the existence of a balance of payments
need does not, in itself, entitle a member to draw on the IMF.
The concept of balance of payments need has evolved over time. The con-
cept includes three distinct elements: the balance of payments position of
the member, its foreign reserve position, and developments in its reserve
position.12 These three elements are regarded as separate, and a representa-
tion of need can be based on any one of them. An operational framework
has been developed over the years to serve as the basis for judgments on the
magnitude of balance of payments deficits and the adequacy of foreign
reserves. In the implementation of this framework, the circumstances of
members are taken into account.
Once an arrangement has been approved by the IMF, a member’s repre-
sentation of balance of payments need to make a purchase is not subject to
challenge, under a long-standing policy intended to assure the member of
the availability of IMF resources committed to it, subject only to its meeting
conditions specified in the arrangement. However, the IMF may take reme-
dial action after a purchase under an arrangement or a reserve tranche pur-
chase if it finds that the conditions for the purchase were not met, including
that of balance of payments need.
Other conditions may also be required. The IMF’s policies under particu-
lar facilities may also stipulate requirements concerning the origins and
nature of the underlying balance of payments disequilibrium. For instance,
