Current Borrowing Arrangements
The General Arrangements to Borrow have been in place since 1962. The
GAB were originally conceived as arrangements whereby the main industrial
(Group of Ten) countries agreed to stand ready to lend the IMF up to speci-
fied amounts of their currencies, thereby strengthening its financial position.
These loans would be made when supplementary resources were needed by
the IMF to help finance drawings by GAB participants in a setting where such
financing would forestall or cope with an impairment of the international
monetary system. Because the industrial countries have the largest quotas
and may, when they need to, claim a large proportion of the IMF’s usable
resources, the GAB provide strong support for the IMF’s financial soundness
and for ensuring that resources available to other countries are not reduced.
