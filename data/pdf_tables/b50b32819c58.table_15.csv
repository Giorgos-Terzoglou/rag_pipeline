BOX II.3. EVOLUTION OF IMF POLICIES ON REPURCHASES
Under the original Articles of Agreement, there were no fixed repurchase
periods for the use of IMF resources: repurchases were calculated annually for
each member according to a formula based on their international reserves.
This reflected the principle that the IMF’s resources are made available only to
members with a balance of payments and reserve need, and was designed to
ensure their revolving character.
This approach became unworkable over time, however, and was increasingly
supplemented by policies on repurchase periods. The coexistence of these two
approaches—one based on explicit schedules and another on reserve
strength—was codified under the Second Amendment of the Articles in 1978
with the establishment of fixed repurchase periods (ArticleV, Section7(c))
and provision for early repurchase by members as their balance of payments
and reserve position improves (ArticleV, Section7(b)).
A major change in the repurchase policies was introduced in 1997 with the
establishment of the SRF to help members experiencing exceptional balance
of payments difficulties owing to a large short-term financing need resulting
from a sudden and disruptive loss of market confidence. In line with the short-
term nature of this type of balance of payments need, the SRF incorporates
much shorter repurchase periods and features repurchase expectations that
are legally outside of the framework of Article V, Section 7(b). Repurchases
under the SRF are expected to be made in two installments after 1 and 1½
years from the date of the purchase. In order to provide flexibility for cases
where the member’s return to capital markets takes longer than anticipated,
each repurchase can be extended by up to 1 year, upon request by the member
and approval of the request by the Executive Board. The same repurchase pro-
file was adopted for the CCL in 1999.
Repurchase expectations were introduced for purchases in the credit
tranches and under the EFF and the CFF in November 2000. These time-based
repurchase expectations (see Table II.2) can be extended upon request by the
member, in which case repurchases would fall due according to the original
obligation schedule. Waivers are considered by the Executive Board if the
member’s external position is not strong enough for the member to pay early
without undue hardship or risk. Adjustment programs supported by credit
tranche or EFF resources are generally designed on the basis of the obligation
schedule for repurchases, so that in most cases members will be in a position to
meet repurchase expectations only if their external position is stronger than
projected at the outset of the program. In contrast, adjustment programs sup-
ported by SRF and CCL resources are designed on the basis of the expectation
schedule from repurchases.
