purchase in the first credit tranche raises the use of IMF credit to no more
than 25percent of quota. The three subsequent tranches are known as the
upper credit tranches. Over time, access to IMF credit substantially above
100percent of quota under the credit tranches has been permitted; accord-
ingly, the upper credit tranches now refer more generally to any use of IMF
credit beyond the first credit tranche. Resources drawn in the credit tranches
can be used to meet any balance of payments need.
The segmentation in terms of first and upper credit tranches underscores
the basic principle that the IMF requires stronger justification in terms of
policy understandings from the member at higher levels of IMF credit out-
standing. Conditionality is the mechanism that gives the IMF the needed
assurances. The IMF adopts a more liberal attitude in making resources
available in the first credit tranche than in the upper credit tranches, pro-
vided that the member is making reasonable efforts to solve its balance of
payments problems. Requests for use of IMF resources beyond the first
credit tranche require substantial justification for the expectation that the
member’s balance of payments difficulties will be resolved within a reason-
able period of time.
Access to the upper credit tranches is normally made under Stand-By
Arrangements. These are lines of credit from the IMF under which a “mem-
ber is assured that it will be able to make purchases from the General
Resources Account in accordance with the terms of the decision during a
specified period and up to a specified amount.”22 Stand-By Arrangements
have long been the core lending instrument of the institution. They were ini-
tially intended as precautionary instruments, to be drawn on only if pay-
ments difficulties emerged, but have been used more commonly as a source
of external financing. Stand-By Arrangements that are treated by members
as precautionary, either at the outset of the arrangement or after immediate
financing constraints have eased, have again emerged following the opening
of world capital markets.
Stand-By Arrangements typically cover a period of 1–1½ years but can be
longer, up to a maximum of 3 years. Performance criteria, the phasing of pur-
chases, and program reviews apply to the use of IMF resources in the upper
credit tranches, but not in the first credit tranche, even under a Stand-By
Arrangement.23 Repurchases are expected each quarter 2¼–4 years after
22ArticleXXX(b).
23Outright purchases without IMF arrangements can take place, but are rare.
