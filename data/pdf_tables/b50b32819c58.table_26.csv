credit tranche. Two basic types of emergencies are covered by this policy:
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes; and post-
conflict situations, following social disruptions.
Emergency assistance for natural disasters is available where the member
cannot meet its immediate financing needs arising from a natural disaster
without serious depletion of its foreign reserves. If this exigency were not
present, however, IMF assistance for these members could be provided
under the CFF or a Stand-By or an Extended Arrangement. The policy con-
ditions include a statement of the general policies the member intends to
pursue, and some assurance that the member will cooperate with the IMF in
an effort to find, where appropriate, solutions for its balance of payments
difficulties.
In post-conflict situations, emergency assistance can be made available
where there is an urgent balance of payments need and a role for the IMF in
catalyzing support from others, but where the institutional and administra-
tive capacity of the member has been disrupted as a result of social conflict,
so that the member is not yet able to develop and implement a comprehen-
sive economic program that could be supported by an IMF arrangement. In
these circumstances, there must nevertheless be sufficient capacity for plan-
ning and policy implementation and a demonstrated commitment by the
authorities. Support from the IMF in these cases must be part of a concerted
international effort to address the aftermath of the conflict situation in a
comprehensive way.
IMF assistance in emergency situations was initially provided through the
flexible application of policies on the use of the credit tranches, but since 2000
has been subject to a special policy outside the credit tranches. Access is nor-
mally limited to 25percent of quota. Larger amounts can be made available
on an exceptional basis: a further 25percent of quota can be provided in post-
conflict situations where progress on capacity rebuilding has been slow and
the member is not in a position to move to an IMF arrangement after one year
but where there is sufficient evidence of the authorities’ commitment to
reform and capacity to implement policies; tranching of disbursements may be
appropriate in these cases. Purchases under emergency assistance are subject
to the basic rate of charge and a maximum repurchase period of 3¼–5 years,
but are not subject to time-based repurchase expectations and do not count
toward the calculation of the surcharge on IMF credit in excess of 200percent
of quota. The IMF has set up a special administered account with the purpose
of providing PRGF-eligible countries with post-conflict emergency assistance
