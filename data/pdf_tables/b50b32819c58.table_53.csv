replace the GAB, which remain in force. However, the NAB are the first
and principal recourse in the event of a need to provide supplementary
resources to the IMF. The total amount of resources available to the IMF
under the NAB and GAB combined is SDR 34 billion.
The NAB can be renewed and enlarged. The NAB decision will be in
effect for five years from its effective date and may be renewed, at which
time an IMF member or institution that is not currently a participant in the
NAB may be accepted as a participant, if the IMF and participants repre-
senting 80 percent of the total credit arrangements agree to the request. New
participants may be accepted at other times by way of an amendment to the
NAB adopted by a decision of the IMF’s Executive Board and with the con-
currence of participants representing 85 percent of total credit arrange-
ments. Commitments from participants are based on relative economic
strength, as measured by actual IMF quotas, as a predominant criterion.
Activation procedures for the NAB are modeled on the GAB. The NAB
have been activated once—to finance a Stand-By Arrangement for Brazil in
December 1998, when the IMF called on funding of SDR 9.1 billion (SDR
2.9 billion of which was used). This activation was canceled on March 11,
1999, when the IMF repaid the outstanding amount following the entry into
effect of the Eleventh General Review of Quotas and payment of the bulk
of the quota increases.
Past Borrowing Arrangements
The IMF borrowed extensively when payments imbalances were large and
persistent. Reliance on borrowing was especially heavy during the period of
large payments imbalances between the early 1970s and the mid-1980s, when
borrowing financed 40–60percent of IMF credit. The need for supplemental
resources to meet the heavy demand for IMF resources stemmed in part
from the relatively small increases in quotas approved in the 1970s, and the
need to bridge to the increases in quotas in 1980 and 1983. Also important
was the skewed distribution of payments imbalances relative to the distribu-
tion of quotas at the time:
• large payments surpluses were concentrated in a comparatively small
number of members with relatively small quotas; and
• payments deficits were far more widely dispersed and were large rela-
tive to the quotas of most members.
The IMF has borrowed only from official sources. Borrowing has been
almost exclusively from members or their monetary authorities, the excep-
tions being nonmember Switzerland (now a member), the Hong Kong Mon-
