FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
BOX II.8. RESERVE TRANCHE POLICIES
The reserve tranche can be considered as the “facility of first resort.” It
stands apart from the credit tranches and the various facilities in that a mem-
ber’s reserve tranche position is part of its own foreign exchange reserves. Pur-
chases in the reserve tranche do not therefore constitute use of IMF credit. To
preserve this character as a reserve asset available at the discretion of the
member, the IMF has adopted reserve tranche policies:
• The definition of the reserve tranche (quota less holdings of the member’s
currency) explicitly excludes currency holdings arising from past use of IMF
credit. This is intended to enable members to make purchases in the credit
tranches without having first to use their reserve tranche. The member can
choose which resources to use first.
• Purchases in the reserve tranche are subject to a representation by the
member of a balance of payments need, as with any use of IMF resources, but
the member’s representation of need cannot be challenged by the IMF.
• Reserve tranche purchases are not subject to conditionality, charges, or
repurchase expectations and obligations.
ing from overdue obligations and the risk that debtor members in good
standing might at some point fall into arrears. This latter risk increases with
the level and concentration of outstanding credit, but is contained by the
positive economic effects of members’ adjustment policies and the IMF’s
preferred creditor status. Reserves also provide a small amount of liquidity
in the GRA. The level and composition of the precautionary balances in the
GRA in recent years are shown in Table II.5.
Reserves reflect accumulated net income and comprise the Special Reserve
and the General Reserve. Resources in the Special Reserve may be used for
any purpose for which resources in the General Reserve may be used, except
distribution.
• The Special Reserve was established in 1957, initially with the proceeds
from a gold investment program, to provide safeguards against opera-
tional deficits that were subsequently charged against this reserve.
Additions to the Special Reserve have since been financed from net
income, other than income derived from the SRF.
• The General Reserve was established in 1958 to meet capital losses or
administrative deficits. From FY1998, SRF net income has been placed
