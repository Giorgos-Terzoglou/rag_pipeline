each purchase, but these expectations can be extended to a maximum repur-
chase period of 3¼–5years. In addition to the charges for the use of IMF
credit, members pay a commitment fee for Stand-By Arrangements, which is
refunded to the extent that amounts under the arrangement are purchased
(Table II.2 summarizes the terms of IMF credit under the various policies
and facilities).
Extended Fund Facility
The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) was established in 1974 as a vehicle for
longer-term external financing for members undertaking needed structural
economic reforms. The EFF is designed for economies:
• suffering serious payments imbalances relating to structural maladjust-
ments in production and trade and where price and cost distortions
have been widespread, or
• characterized by slow growth and an inherently weak balance of pay-
ments position, which prevent pursuit of an active development policy.
The EFF is especially appropriate for members graduating from the Pov-
erty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) programs or transition econo-
mies that lack adequate capital market access. At the same time, the EFF
and all other IMF facilities are available in principle to any member that
meets the eligibility criteria.
Members drawing under the EFF do so in the context of an Extended
Arrangement. These are three-year IMF arrangements, which can be
extended for a fourth year. Performance criteria and purchases typically fol-
low a semiannual schedule. Repurchases are also made semiannually, and
over a longer period than applies to the credit tranches: repurchases are
expected 4½–7 years after each purchase but this can be extended to the
maximum repurchase period of 4½–10 years. Members pay a refundable
commitment fee for Extended Arrangements, as well as the applicable
charges for the use of IMF credit.
Supplemental Reserve Facility
The Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) was established at the end of
1997, at the height of the Asian financial crisis. Its purpose is to provide
financial assistance to members experiencing exceptional balance of pay-
ments difficulties due to a large, short-term financing need following a sud-
den and disruptive loss of confidence reflected in pressure on the capital
account and the member’s foreign reserves. Access under the SRF is separate
