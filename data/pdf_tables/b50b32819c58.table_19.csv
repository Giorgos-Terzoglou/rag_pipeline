Financial Policies and Facilities
The lending instruments of the IMF have evolved over the years. In its
early years, IMF lending took place exclusively on the basis of general poli-
cies on access in what became known as the credit tranches and, in particu-
lar, under Stand-By Arrangements. Beginning in the 1960s, special policies
were developed to deal with various balance of payments problems having
particular causes, resulting over time in a multiplicity of policies on the use
of IMF resources.21 Special policies on the use of IMF resources outside the
credit tranches are generally referred to as facilities.
All decisions on the extension of IMF credit are taken by the Executive
Board. These decisions are supported by a formal request from the member
and an assessment by the staff of the nature and magnitude of the balance of
payments problem, the adequacy of the policy response, and the capacity of
the member to repay the IMF. In 1995, the IMF specified streamlined proce-
dures under an Emergency Financing Mechanism to allow for quicker Exec-
utive Board approval of IMF financial support. This mechanism is used in
circumstances representing, or threatening, a crisis in a member’s external
accounts that requires an immediate response from the IMF, as was the case
in 1997 for Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand and in July 1998
for Russia.
A fundamental review of IMF financial policies and facilities took place in
2000, which resulted in a more streamlined structure, with a sharper focus on
crisis prevention and ensuring effective use of IMF resources. This section
describes the current structure of policies and facilities; earlier lending
instruments are noted in BoxII.5.
20Members have the option of combining all repurchases due within a calendar month,
provided that the combined repurchase is completed not later than the last day of the
month and that no single repurchase remains outstanding for a period exceeding the maxi-
mum permitted under the relevant policy of the IMF.
