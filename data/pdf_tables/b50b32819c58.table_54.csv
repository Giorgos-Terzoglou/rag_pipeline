etary Authority (under the NAB), and the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS). Borrowing from official sources has the advantage that
these lenders are familiar with the IMF’s needs and operational features,
and there is by now a substantial body of experience from which to draw.
The IMF is permitted to borrow from private sources and has considered
this option on several occasions: the prevailing view has been that resort to
private market borrowing would change the cooperative and monetary
nature of the institution in ways that would be undesirable; a number of
operational issues would also need to be addressed, such as the use of collat-
eral, managing financial risk, and the cost relative to official borrowing.
Borrowing arrangements share many common characteristics:
• Denomination of borrowing. The indebtedness of members to the IMF
is denominated in SDRs. To avoid exchange risks, IMF borrowing has
generally been denominated in SDRs or the currencies that make up
the SDR basket in proportion to their weight in that basket.
• Media of payment. The IMF cannot borrow SDRs. In most bilateral bor-
rowing agreements, the lender has provided U.S.dollars or its own freely
usable currency, or the lender has undertaken to convert its currency into
a freely usable currency as needed by the IMF. For repayment, the IMF
has generally sought maximum flexibility in the borrowing agreement
but lenders have on occasion insisted on repayment in the currency of
their choice, usually U.S.dollars or their own currency.
• Maturities. The IMF seeks to match the maturities of its assets and liabil-
ities. Under the two Oil Facilities and the SFF, for example, the IMF bor-
rowed when currency was needed for purchase and repaid lenders when
the corresponding repurchases were made. This was not possible under
the borrowing agreements established for the Enlarged Access Policy
(EAP), as some central banks were willing to lend only at the short end
of the maturity spectrum (see Table II.7). The resulting mismatch of
maturities led to the establishment of Borrowed Resources Suspense
Accounts within the GRA as a means of holding and investing tempo-
rarily currencies not yet needed to finance purchases under the EAP.
• Liquidity and transferability. Borrowing agreements with lenders other
than the BIS have consistently provided for encashability at face value
upon representation of balance of payments need. These agreements
further stipulate that the IMF would give such a representation the
overwhelming benefit of the doubt. A member’s lending to the IMF is
therefore regarded as a liquid reserve asset and is included as part of
the member’s international reserves. In addition, claims on the IMF are
