depository. Thus, the IMF’s pool of currencies and reserve assets in the
GRA are not held at the IMF, but in depositories in the member countries.
The depository maintains, without any service charge or commission, two
accounts that are used to record the IMF’s holdings of the member’s currency:
the IMF No. 1 Account and the IMF No. 2 Account. The No. 1 Account is
used for IMF transactions, including subscription payments, purchases and
repurchases (i.e., use and repayment of GRA resources), and repayment of
resources borrowed by the IMF. Payment of charges on the use of IMF credit
and the IMF’s payment of interest on reserve tranche positions are conducted
in SDRs and therefore not recorded in these accounts. Provided that a mini-
mum is maintained in the No. 1 Account, as explained below, all these transac-
tions can alternatively be carried out through the IMF Securities Account. A
member may establish an IMF Securities Account in order to substitute parts
of the holdings in the IMF No. 1 Account with nonnegotiable, non-inter-
est-bearing notes, or similar instruments payable to the IMF on demand when
the currency is needed for the IMF’s transactions. The depository holds these
notes for safekeeping and acts as the agent of the IMF to obtain encashment
of the notes in order to maintain, at all times, the minimum required balance
in the No. 1 Account.52
The No. 2 Account is used for the IMF’s administrative expenditures and
receipts (for example, from sales of IMF publications) in the member’s cur-
rency and within its territory. The balances in both the No. 1 and No. 2
Accounts that originate from the payment of the local currency portion of
quota subscriptions do not yield any interest for the IMF. The currency por-
tion of the subscribed capital, while fully paid, is held in non-interest-bearing
form and generates no income for the IMF until used and converted into
claims on members in the form of use of IMF credit.
