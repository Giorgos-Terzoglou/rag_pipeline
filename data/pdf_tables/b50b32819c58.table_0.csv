General Department
Introduction
The IMF’s resources are held in the General Department, which consists
of three separate accounts: the General Resources Account (GRA), the
Special Disbursement Account (SDA), and the Investment Account.
General Resources Account
The GRA is the principal account of the IMF and handles by far the larg-
est share of transactions between the IMF and its membership. The GRA
can best be described as a pool of currencies and reserve assets built up from
members’ fully paid capital subscriptions in the form of quotas.1 Quotas are
the basic building blocks of the IMF. They broadly reflect each member’s
relative economic size, taking into account the quotas of similar countries.
Quotas determine the maximum amount of financial resources that a mem-
ber is obligated to provide to the IMF, voting power in IMF decision making,
and a member’s share of SDR allocations. The financial assistance a member
may obtain from the IMF is also generally based on its quota.
The financial structure of the IMF rests on the principle that quota sub-
scriptions are the basic source of financing for the GRA. A quarter of a
member’s quota subscription is normally paid in reserve assets, with the
remainder paid in the member’s own currency.2 Currencies held by the IMF
are of two types, usable and unusable. A currency is usable if the issuing
member’s external payments position is strong enough for it to be called
upon to finance IMF credit to other members. Other currencies, that is, the
1Reserve assets are those that are readily available and accepted for international pay-
ments, such as the four currencies currently recognized as “freely usable” by the IMF: the
U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and pound sterling. A freely usable currency is one that the
IMF determines is widely used to make payments for international transactions and is
traded in the principal exchange markets.
2Prior to the Second Amendment of the IMF Articles on April 1, 1978, the reserve asset
portion was paid in gold, and after that, in SDRs or “usable” currencies of other members
as determined by the IMF.
