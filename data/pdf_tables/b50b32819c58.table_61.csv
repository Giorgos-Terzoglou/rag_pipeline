FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
payments assistance on concessional terms to qualifying low-income mem-
ber countries, from 1986 until the end of 1995, when the SAF itself was
phased out.51 From the establishment of the Enhanced Structural Adjust-
ment Facility (ESAF) in December 1987 until February 1994, unused SDA
resources were also used to finance ESAF loans.
The assets of the SDA now consist of the remaining loan balances out-
standing under the SAF and investments in marketable fixed-income securi-
ties. These assets originate from the transfers received from the Trust Fund
and the profits from the sale of a portion of the IMF’s gold in financial year
2000. The net income from the investment of gold profits has been autho-
rized for transfers, on an as-needed basis in accordance with the decisions of
the IMF, to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility–Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries Trust (PRGF-HIPC Trust).
Chapter IV discusses the financing and conduct of concessional lending by
the IMF, including the investment of SDA resources.
IMF Accounts in Member Countries
The IMF conducts its financial dealings with a member through the fiscal
agency and the depository designated by the member. The fiscal agency may
be the member’s treasury (ministry of finance), central bank, official mone-
tary agency, stabilization fund, or other similar agency. The IMF can only
deal with, or through, the designated fiscal agency, which is authorized to
carry out transactions with the IMF on behalf of the member country. In
addition, each member is required to designate its central bank as a deposi-
tory for the IMF’s holdings of the member’s currency, or if it has no central
bank, a monetary agency or a commercial bank acceptable to the IMF. Most
members of the IMF have designated their central bank as both the deposi-
tory and the fiscal agency. The depository is required to pay out of the IMF’s
holdings of the member’s currency, on demand and without delay, sums to
any payee named by the IMF in the member’s own territory, and to hold
securities on behalf of the IMF should the member decide to issue nonnego-
tiable, non-interest-bearing notes, or similar instruments, in substitution for
part of the IMF’s currency holdings. Each member guarantees all assets of
the IMF against loss resulting from failure or default on the part of the
51Interest on SAF loans is charged at ½ of 1 percent a year.
