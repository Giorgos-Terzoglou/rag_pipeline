members. Four reviews concluded that no increase in quotas was needed. In
the other eight reviews, the overall quota increase ranged from 31 percent to
61 percent (Tables II.3 and II.4).
Increases in members’ quotas during general reviews typically consist of
two elements: (1) an equiproportional element which is distributed to all
members according to their existing quota shares; and (2) a selective ele-
ment which is distributed to either all members or a subset of members. The
selective element is used to attain a change in quota shares among members.
For any overall increase in quotas, the larger the selective increase, the
greater the redistribution of quota shares. In practice, the selective compo-
nent has tended to be relatively small.
Both the list of members eligible for a selective increase and the way of dis-
tributing the selective element are based on the Executive Board’s judgment.
The distribution of selective quota increases have generally been based on
calculated quotas.32 Calculated quotas are determined by the quota formulas,
which have been designed to provide a quantified measure of a country’s rela-
tive economic position.33 The following examples illustrate the methods used.
• During the Sixth Review in 1976, the Executive Board decided to dou-
ble the quota share of the major oil exporters with the stipulation that
the collective share of all the developing countries should not fall. The
decision was based on the judgment that such a reallocation would
strengthen the IMF’s liquidity. In this instance, the quota formulas
played no role in identifying the members eligible for the selective
increase.
• Under the Eleventh Review in 1998, 25 percent of the quota increase
was selective. The quota formulas helped determine each member’s
share of the selective increase as follows: (1) 15 percent of the total
increase (three-fifths of the selective element) was distributed to all
members; (2) in addition, 10 percent of the total increase was distributed
32Since the Eighth Review in 1982/83, all members have received an increase comprised
of an equiproportional element and a selective element that reflected a member’s share in
calculated quotas.
33As further explained below, formulas are one element in determining actual quotas. While
quota formulas are not mentioned in the Articles, and the Executive Board has not formally
adopted any formula, the Board has usually relied on them as an independent measure of
members’ relative economic position in the world economy. Typically, the quota resulting from
the formulas—the calculated quota—is different from the actual quota of a member and, in
the most recent review, actual quotas were on average less than half of calculated quotas.
