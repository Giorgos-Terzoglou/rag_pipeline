Interest on SDR holdings 112.5

SDA income
Income earned on investments 150.0
Interest on loans 1.4
Net SDA income 151.4
Note: Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.
A separate midyear review is undertaken to establish whether an adjust-
ment to the basic rate of charge is required in view of developments during
the year.
At the end of the financial year, if net income exceeds the amount pro-
jected at the beginning of the year, the Executive Board has, in recent years,
decided to reduce the rate of charge retroactively. Alternatively, the Board
can decide to:
• place all or part of any excess to reserves; or
• make a distribution of excess income to members; or
• take the excess into account to lower the net income target for the sub-
sequent financial year.
When net income falls short of the target, the Executive Board has gener-
ally decided to increase the rate of charge in the subsequent financial year to
make up for the shortfall.
