BOX II.7. THE PRESENT FIVE QUOTA FORMULAS
The present five quota formulas, with the Bretton Woods formula listed
first, are:
CQ = (0.01Y + 0.025R + 0.05P + 0.2276VC)(1 + C/Y),
CQ = (0.0065Y + 0.0205125R + 0.078P + 0.4052VC)(1 + C/Y),
CQ = (0.0045Y + 0.03896768R + 0.07P + 0.76976VC)(1 + C/Y),
CQ = 0.005Y + 0.042280464R + 0.044 (P + C) + 0.8352VC,
CQ = 0.0045Y + 0.05281008R + 0.039 (P + C) + 1.0432VC,
where CQ = calculated quota;
Y = GDP at current market prices for a recent year;
R = twelve-month average of gold and foreign exchange
reserves, including SDR holdings and reserve positions
in the IMF, for a recent year;
P = annual average of current payments (goods, services,
income, and private transfers) for a recent
five-year period;
C = annual average of current receipts (goods, services,
income, and private transfers) for a recent five-year
period; and
VC = variability of current receipts, defined as one standard
deviation from the five-year moving average centered
on the third year, for a recent 13-year period.
For each of the four non–Bretton Woods formulas, quota calculations are
multiplied by an adjustment factor so that the sum of the calculations across
members equals that derived from the Bretton Woods formula. The calcu-
lated quota of a member is the higher of the Bretton Woods calculation or
the average of the lowest two of the remaining four calculations (after
adjustment).
