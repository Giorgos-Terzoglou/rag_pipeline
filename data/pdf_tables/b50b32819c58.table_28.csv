II General Department
• at the request of a member during the year, for example, at the end of
the member’s financial year; and
• on such other occasions as the IMF may decide.
Whenever it becomes necessary to adjust the rate at which the IMF has
recorded the use of a member’s currency, the new rate becomes effective in
the IMF’s accounts at the close of business on the date that the new
exchange rate is determined. All holdings of a member’s currency in the
GRA, including any unsettled obligations resulting from an earlier revalua-
tion, are revalued at the new rate. The new rate is applied to all transactions
in that currency, including administrative receipts and payments, until such a
time as the rate may again need to be adjusted.
The currency valuation adjustments are part of the IMF’s holdings of
members’ currencies. Whenever the IMF revalues its holdings of a member’s
currency, reflecting a change in its exchange rate with the SDR, an account
receivable or an account payable is established for the amount of currency
payable by or to the member in order to maintain the value of holdings of
the member’s currency in terms of the SDR.
SDR Holdings
The IMF does not receive allocations of SDRs, but obtains its SDRs as
payment of the reserve asset portion of quota subscriptions and in settle-
ment of charges and, to a lesser degree, repayment of credit. The IMF, in
turn, uses these SDRs to pay interest on creditor positions and to provide
credit to members. Since SDRs were created as a supplement to existing
reserve assets, the IMF does not maintain large holdings of SDRs for long
periods of time, but rather recirculates the SDRs it receives back to the
membership. The SDR system, and the key role of the GRA in the circula-
tion of SDRs, is discussed in Chapter III.
Gold Holdings
The IMF holds 103 million fine (troy) ounces (3,217 metric tons) of gold at
designated official depositories, making it the third largest official holder of
gold after the United States and Germany. IMF holdings account for about
10 percent of total official gold stocks. The IMF acquired its gold in various
ways (Box II.6). The IMF’s gold holdings are valued on its balance sheet on
the basis of historical cost, with a book value of SDR 5.9 billion. Valued at
end-April 2001 market prices, the IMF’s holdings amount to over SDR21
billion (about $27 billion).
