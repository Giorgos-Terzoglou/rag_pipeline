to those countries whose ratio of calculated to actual quotas was consid-
ered to be most “out of line.”34
Adjustments of quota shares have tended to take place within general
reviews, usually in the context of an urgent need for additional resources on
the part of the IMF. This reflects the fact that it has been easier to reach
agreement if all members receive an increase in quotas. Agreement is more
difficult to reach when only a subset of members receives an increase, as the
quotas of all other members would remain unchanged and their quota
shares would decline.
Ad Hoc Increases
A member can request an adjustment of its quota at any time.35 Ad hoc
quota increases can occur both within and outside the context of a general
review. In recent years, they have tended to occur within a general review.
As with selective increases, both the quota formulas and the Executive
Board’s judgment have played a role in determining the amount of the ad
hoc adjustment. The following are examples.
• Five members (France, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Paraguay,
and the Philippines) received ad hoc increases between 1947 and 1959.
The main factor underlying these increases was the view that the initial
quotas of these members at the time of the Bretton Woods conference in
1945 had been set at unduly low levels. Between 1959 and 1969, the quo-
tas of another nine countries were adjusted on an ad hoc basis. All of the
foregoing increases occurred outside the context of a general review.
• Japan received an ad hoc increase under the Ninth Review. In this case,
the seven largest industrial countries agreed to redistribute quota
increases among themselves in such a manner that the quota increases
for the rest of the membership were not affected.36
34“Out of line” was defined as those countries with ratios of calculated to actual quotas
above one. Thirty-eight members met this criterion. Five of these members, whose quotas
were farthest out of line and which were able to contribute to the IMF’s liquidity over the
medium term, received 1 percent of the 10 percent share going to the group of 38 members.
35Under Article III, Section 2(a), the IMF may, “if it thinks fit, consider at any other
time the adjustment of any particular quota at the request of the member concerned.”
36As a result of this redistribution to accommodate an ad hoc increase in the quota of
Japan, the new quotas for Germany and Japan were equalized, as were the quotas of
France and the United Kingdom (ranked just below those of Japan and Germany), and
adjustments were made to the quotas of the United States, Canada, and Italy so that the
total quotas for the seven countries as a group was maintained unchanged.
