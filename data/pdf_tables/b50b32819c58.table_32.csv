FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
• The IMF’s holdings of usable currencies in the GRA were lower, and
reserve tranche positions higher, than they would otherwise have been
by the amount of profit (SDR 2.2billion). This is because Brazil and
Mexico paid in gold instead of usable currencies, which would have
been used to reduce reserve tranche positions of creditor members.
• The IMF’s net income is affected by the remuneration expense on the
continuing enlarged reserve tranche positions. The additional remuner-
ation expense varies with the rate of remuneration, and amounted to an
estimated SDR 94 million in FY2001. For comparison, the IMF’s net
income target for FY2001, the first year in which the full income effect
of the off-market gold transactions was felt, was SDR 48 million, and
for FY2002 net income is targeted at SDR 51 million.
While the transactions were successful in that they allowed the IMF to
contribute to the resolution of the debt problems of the HIPCs, they
resulted in an increase in the IMF’s cost of operations. Since, under standard
procedures (see the discussion of “Operational Income” below), this rela-
tively large increase in cost would have resulted in a higher rate of charge,
the cost increase was mitigated or offset through the existing burden-sharing
mechanism and placed in the SCA-1. In the same way, SDR 94 million is
being generated in FY2002.
The Resource and Liability Side
Quotas
Each member of the IMF is assigned a quota and pays a capital subscrip-
tion to the IMF that is equal to its quota. As noted earlier, a quarter of a
member’s quota subscription is normally paid in reserve assets, with the
remainder paid in the member’s own currency.27 Quotas are expressed in
SDRs and their size is determined by the IMF’s Board of Governors,
broadly on the basis of the economic size of the country, and taking into
account quotas of similar countries. To help in this determination, five for-
mulas are used that relate the quota to the size of the country’s GDP, current
account transactions, and official reserves. As of April 30, 2001, total quotas
27The IMF has made arrangements to assist members with insufficient reserves to pay
the reserve asset portion of their quota subscription payment through a same-day, no-cost
IMF lending operation (see Chapter III, Box III.4).
