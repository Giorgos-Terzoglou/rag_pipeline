Currency selection is based on judgments about the external positions of
members. The currencies of members are selected for inclusion in the finan-
cial transactions plan based on a finding by the IMF that the member’s bal-
ance of payments and reserve position is sufficiently strong. Specific indicators
of external strength are used to maintain a reasonable degree of consistency
among members, but the assessment of a member’s combined balance of pay-
ments and reserve position is ultimately a matter of judgment. It has not
therefore been considered desirable to rely on automatic indicators or to
define rigidly the notion of a sufficiently strong external position; the circum-
stances of members, including their need to hold reserves, differ considerably.
All relevant factors and data are considered in this assessment. Particular
emphasis is placed on recent and prospective current account balances,
external competitiveness, and external debt indicators, especially those
offering insights into the member’s exposure to short-term liquidity strains.
Members may be included in the financial transactions plan even though
there may be some elements of weakness in their overall balance of pay-
ments and reserve position.
Two broader considerations underlying the financial structure of the IMF
have guided the staff and the Executive Board in coming to conclusions
about a member’s external strength for the purpose of participation in the
financial transactions plan.
• First, the IMF draws on a wide range of members—large and small,
advanced, developing, and transition—for its financial activities, reflect-
ing first and foremost the cooperative nature of the institution. Broad
participation of members in the financial transactions plan also works to
maximize the liquidity of the GRA.
• Second, the use of a member’s currency in the financial transactions plan
generally entails a change in the composition of the member’s interna-
tional reserves. For most of these members, IMF transactions involve a
reduction (increase) in their foreign exchange holdings, which is fully
offset by an increase (decrease) in their reserve tranche position in the
IMF. This creditor position is included as part of the member’s interna-
tional reserves as it is a liquid claim on foreign exchange resources that
can be drawn on demand in the event of balance of payments need.
Decisions on the selection of currencies are taken by the Executive
Board. The staff proposes a list of members it considers sufficiently strong
each quarter, and the Executive Board takes a decision based on this list. It
