Total SDA 2.8
Total assets 220.3 Total resources and liabilities 220.3
Note: Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.
At end-April 2001, the IMF did not have any outstanding borrowing, but if it
had, the amount of borrowing outstanding would have been shown on the
liabilities side, with additional offsetting credit extended by the IMF to its
members on the asset side. A comparison of the relative size of these
resources and liabilities demonstrates that the IMF is overwhelmingly a
quota-based institution.
