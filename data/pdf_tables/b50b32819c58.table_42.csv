FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
Board, along with a staff commentary, in August 2000. The report and staff
commentary were subsequently published on the IMF’s website.37
The QFRG report provided information about the history and operation
of the quota formulas, suggested guiding principles for future reforms, and
presented recommendations to simplify and update the formulas. The Exec-
utive Board discussion revealed a wide range of views on the issues raised in
the report and the staff commentary. There was general recognition of the
need to simplify the present formulas and to update them to take account of
the growing role of capital flows. However, concern was expressed that a
preliminary partial quantification of the formula recommended by the panel
pointed toward a greater concentration of quotas among the largest indus-
trial countries (subsequently confirmed by more complete and updated staff
calculations).38 Executive Directors agreed on the need to carry forward the
work of the external panel with a view to developing quota formulas that
more fully reflect members’ roles in the world economy. The International
Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) supported this view at their
meeting in Prague in September 2001, and a work program has been
adopted to further consider alternative quota formulas prior to the 2001
Annual Meetings.
Reserve Tranche Positions
In making the reserve asset portion of their quota payment, members
acquire a liquid claim on the IMF in exchange for the reserves they provide,
much like a demand deposit in a commercial bank. This claim is called the
reserve tranche position; it is equal to the member’s quota less the IMF’s
holdings of the member’s currency in the GRA (excluding currency holdings
that stem from the member’s own use of credit). The share of a member’s
subscription maintained in reserve assets varies over time from its initial
level of some 25 percent at the time of quota payment. A member’s reserve
tranche position increases when the IMF uses its currency to lend to other
members, and decreases when borrowing members use the currency to make
repayments. Reserve tranche positions are part of members’ liquid interna-
tional reserves because a member may, subject only to its representation of a
balance of payments need, convert its SDR-denominated reserve asset into
