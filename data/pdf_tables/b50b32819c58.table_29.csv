Gold in the Articles of Agreement
Before the Second Amendment of the Articles in April 1978, the role of
gold in the IMF and in the international monetary system was central and
pervasive. The Second Amendment contained a number of provisions that,
in combination, were intended to achieve a gradual reduction of the role of
gold in the international monetary system and in the IMF. The Second
Amendment:
• eliminated the use of gold as the common denominator of the par value
system and as the basis of the value of the SDR;
• abolished the official price of gold and abolished the obligatory uses of
gold in transactions between the IMF and its members;
• required the IMF, in its dealings in gold, to avoid managing its price or
establishing a fixed price of gold; and
• included an undertaking by members to collaborate with the IMF and
other members with respect to reserve assets to promote better interna-
tional surveillance of international liquidity.
The Articles now limit the use of gold in the IMF’s transactions. Any
transactions in gold by the IMF require a decision by an 85 percent majority
of the total voting power in the IMF. The IMF:
• may sell gold outright on the basis of prevailing market prices;
• may accept gold in the discharge of a member’s obligations to the IMF
at an agreed price on the basis of prices in the market at the time of
acceptance;
• does not have the authority to engage in any other gold transactions,
for example, loans, leases, swaps, or use of gold as collateral; and
• does not have the authority to buy gold.
The IMF’s Policy on Gold
The IMF’s policies on gold are governed by the following five principles:
• As an undervalued asset held by the IMF, gold provides fundamental
strength to its balance sheet. Any mobilization of IMF gold should
avoid weakening its overall financial position.
• Gold holdings provide the IMF with operational maneuverability both
as regards the use of its resources and through adding credibility to its
precautionary balances. In these respects, the benefits of the IMF’s gold
holdings are passed on to the membership at large, including both cred-
itors and debtors.
