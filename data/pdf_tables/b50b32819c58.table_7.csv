II General Department
The Balance Sheet
The relationships among the sources and uses of resources in the General
Department, and their relative magnitudes, are summarized in its balance
sheet (Table II.1).
On the asset side, the first major item is credit outstanding at the end of
FY2001 of SDR 42.2 billion, which is the value of financing extended by the
IMF to its members. Financing to debtor members is largely funded by the
use of the currencies of creditor members and is reflected in the resulting
reserve tranche positions of creditor members (see Box II.1). Members with
outstanding credit pay a market-related rate of interest on these loans which
fully covers the payment of interest to the creditors providing the resources
to the IMF, as further explained below. The vast bulk of other assets held by
the IMF in the GRA was usable and other currencies, equal to SDR 165.7 bil-
lion. Gold, valued at SDR 5.9 billion, represented a relatively small share of
total assets.9 The IMF receives no interest on its gold or currency holdings
that do not result from the extension of IMF credit. The only interest-bearing
asset held by the IMF other than its outstanding credit is its holdings of
SDRs, which were SDR 2.4 billion. With the addition of some minor receiv-
ables and other assets, total assets of the GRA at end-April 2001 amounted
to SDR 217.5 billion.
On the resources and liabilities side, total quota resources were SDR212.4
billion on April30, 2001. As noted above, some of these subscription
resources were usable and some were not. Usable currencies amounted to
SDR 109.7 billion and unusable currencies SDR 56.0 billion. In addition,
there were SDR 46.7 billion in reserve tranche positions of members. The
reserve tranche positions of IMF members result from initial quota payments
and the increase due to the extension of IMF credit to other members. These
reserve positions earn a market-related rate of return, as explained below.
Precautionary balances, which include reserves and the balance in the Special
Contingent Account (SCA), amounted to an additional SDR 4.5 billion. Add-
ing a small amount of interest (remuneration) payable and some other minor
liabilities gives a total of SDR 217.5 billion of GRA resources and liabilities.
9The IMF’s holdings of gold are valued at historical cost. For most of the gold holdings,
this is SDR 35 a fine ounce. Market prices for gold are much higher, which imparts a funda-
mental strength to the IMF’s financial position. See the discussion below in the section on
“Gold Holdings.”
