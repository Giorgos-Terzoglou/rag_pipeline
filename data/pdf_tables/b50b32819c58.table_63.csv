member with the IMF in its balance sheet.54 A central bank may choose to
indicate this on either a gross or net basis. The position in the General
Department is presented on a gross basis if the IMF No. 1, No. 2, and Securi-
ties Accounts are shown as liabilities and the member’s quota is shown as an
asset. Membership in the SDR Department would be indicated by showing
SDR holdings as an asset and the cumulative SDR allocation as a liability.
Members may also choose to reflect their financial position on a net basis.
A member who has a net reserve tranche position in the IMF and is not
using IMF credit would present the net reserve tranche position as an
asset.55 Members with a net reserve tranche position who are also using
credit in the GRA would disclose the reserve tranche as an asset and cur-
rency holdings stemming from the use of IMF credit as a liability, since the
IMF is not entitled to demand settlement or offset a member’s use of credit
from its reserve tranche position. The members’ position in the SDR
Department may also be shown on a net basis. The presentation of IMF-
related assets and liabilities should be further elaborated in the explanatory
notes to the financial statements and, as a minimum, provide information
not available in the balance sheet regarding the member’s quota, the compo-
sition of the IMF’s currency holdings, and the maturity structure of IMF
credit, if any.
In cases where the central bank acts as depository and the ministry of
finance, treasury, or a similar agency is the fiscal agent, it is recommended
that the central bank record all IMF-related assets and liabilities and offset
these against government accounts.56 While practices may differ depending
on the relationship between the central bank and the agency acting as fiscal
agent, this approach ensures public disclosure of the member’s financial
relationship with the IMF, since government agencies typically do not pre-

position, even though the actual securities may be issued by the government. The IMF con-
siders securities issued in lieu of currency deposits to the IMF No. 1 Account equivalent to
currency holdings because they are encashable on demand. Exclusion of the Securities
Account would therefore misrepresent the member’s overall IMF position.
55A member has a net reserve tranche position when its quota exceeds the IMF’s hold-
ings of its currencies, excluding currencies stemming from the use of IMF credit and hold-
ings in the No. 2 Account that are less than 1⁄ 10 of 1 percent of quota.
