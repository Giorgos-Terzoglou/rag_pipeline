is open to an Executive Director to request the exclusion or inclusion of any
member, but the decision rests with the Executive Board as a whole. A
member’s consent to its inclusion is not required, although its views on its
balance of payments and reserve position are taken into account by the
Executive Board before a decision is taken. The outcome of the financial
transactions plan is published on the IMF’s website.49
Currency allocation aims to maintain broadly even participation among
members. The allocation of transfers and receipts among members in the
financial transactions plan is based on guidelines established by the Executive
Board.50 The currencies of all members included in the financial transactions
plan are allocated for transfers in direct proportion to their quotas. Receipts
are allocated to members’ currencies included in the plan so as to ensure that
the creditor positions of members included in the plan remain broadly bal-
anced over time in relation to quota. The net impact of both transfers and
receipts on reserve tranche positions is illustrated in FigureII.6.
If a currency included in the financial transactions plan is not one of the
currencies that the IMF has determined to be freely usable in the principal
foreign exchange markets, the issuing member is required, if requested by a
purchasing member at the time of the purchase, to exchange the amount of
its currency sold by the IMF for a freely usable currency (in most cases, the
U.S. dollar) at the representative exchange rate as advised by the IMF. Pro-
cedures have also been established for the exchange of each freely usable
currency into other freely usable currencies. Similar procedures apply to
exchanges of currencies related to repurchases.

The Trust Fund had been funded largely from the sale of gold and upon its
termination in 1981, all Trust Fund loan repayments were transferred to the
