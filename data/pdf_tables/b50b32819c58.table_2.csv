BOX II.1. THE IMF’S MAJOR FINANCING MECHANISM
The IMF’s lending is financed from the capital subscribed by member coun-
tries. Each country is assigned a quota that determines its maximum financial
commitment to the IMF. A portion of the quota is provided in the form of
reserve assets (foreign currencies acceptable to the IMF or SDRs) and the
remainder in its own currency. The IMF extends financing by providing reserve
assets to the borrower from the reserve asset subscriptions of members or by
calling on countries that are considered financially strong to exchange their
currency subscriptions for reserve assets.
The loan is disbursed or drawn by the borrower “purchasing” the reserve
assets from the IMF with its own currency.1 Repayment of the loan is achieved
by the borrower “repurchasing” its currency from the IMF with reserve assets.
The IMF levies a basic rate of interest (charges) on loans based on the SDR
interest rate and imposes surcharges depending on the amount and maturity of
the loan and the level of credit outstanding.
A country that provides reserve assets to the IMF as part of its quota sub-
scription or through the use of its currency receives a liquid claim on the IMF
(a reserve, or reserve tranche, position) which can be encashed on demand to
obtain reserve assets to meet a balance of payments financing need.
These claims earn interest (remuneration) based on the SDR interest rate
and are considered by members as part of their international reserve assets. As
IMF loans are repaid (repurchased) by the borrower with reserve assets, these
funds are transferred to the creditor countries in exchange for their currencies
and the creditor claim on the IMF is extinguished.
The purchase-repurchase approach to IMF lending affects the composition
of the IMF’s resources but not the overall size. An increase in loans outstand-
ing will reduce the IMF’s holdings of reserve assets and the currencies of mem-
bers that are financially strong and increase the IMF’s holdings of the
currencies of countries that are borrowing from the IMF. The amount of the
IMF’s holdings of reserve assets and the currencies of financially strong coun-
tries determines the IMF’s lending capacity (liquidity).
While the purchase-repurchase mechanism is not technically or legally a
“loan,” it is the functional equivalent of a loan. Similarly, IMF lending
“arrangements” provide for drawings in installments upon the fulfillment of
certain policy conditions. Thus, they are similar to conditional lines of credit.
For ease of reference, these more commonly understood terms are often used
in this pamphlet rather than the unique internal IMF terminology.
1In making a purchase, the member provides domestic currency to the IMF addi-
tional to currency previously paid to the IMF for the member’s quota subscription.
