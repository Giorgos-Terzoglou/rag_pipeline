II General Department
The rest of the General Department consists solely of the relatively small
amount of assets and liabilities of the SDA, SDR 2.8 billion at end-April
2001. These represent the accumulated resources of the account, which
reflect the profits and investment returns realized on past gold sales on the
resources side, and the investment of these resources on the asset side. The
income from these investments is transferred to the PRGF and PRGF-HIPC
Trusts to provide concessional financial assistance to low-income members.
There was also a small amount (SDR0.4billion) of loans still outstanding
from the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) at end-April 2001.10 These
loans were financed with SDA resources.
The remainder of this chapter expands upon the above discussion. It first
discusses each item on the asset side of the GRA—namely, credit outstand-
ing, which includes a description of the various terms and conditions of IMF
lending, followed by relatively short sections on currency, SDR, and gold
holdings. It then describes each item on the resources and liabilities side of
the GRA—namely, quotas, including reserve tranche positions, and precau-
tionary balances. Next, the chapter explains how the supply of and demand
for GRA resources is managed through the quarterly financial transactions
plan, and how the IMF monitors its overall level of liquidity in the GRA.
Finally, it shows how IMF transactions are reflected in the accounts and bal-
ance sheets of member countries.
The management and investment strategy for the resources in the SDA is
covered in Chapter IV.
The Asset Side
Credit Outstanding
Credit outstanding, as the caption suggests, represents loans already pro-
vided to members under the various IMF facilities. This section first
describes the general terms and conditions of IMF lending, followed by a
discussion of the IMF’s financial policies and lending facilities.
10The SAF is discussed in Chapter IV.
