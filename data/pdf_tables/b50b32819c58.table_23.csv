from the limits that apply to the credit tranches and the EFF, and it has no
explicit limits of its own. SRF resources are provided under Stand-By or
Extended Arrangements. The conditionality in an arrangement involving
SRF resources is that of the associated Stand-By or Extended Arrangement.
The repurchase period for SRF resources is much shorter than that gov-
erning the credit tranches and EFF, reflecting the likelihood of a quicker
turnaround in the balance of payments. Repurchases are made in two
installments and are expected 1–1½ years after each purchase; this period
can be extended up to the maximum repurchase period of 2–2½ years.
Resources drawn under the SRF are subject to the basic rate of charge
applying to all IMF credit and a specific surcharge. During the first year
from the date of the first purchase under the facility, the SRF surcharge is set
at 300basis points, and it rises by 50basis points at the end of the first year
and every six months thereafter, up to a maximum of 500basis points. The
standard commitment fee for Stand-By Arrangements applies.
Contingent Credit Lines
The Contingent Credit Line (CCL) is a new type of lending instrument for
the IMF. Conceived in the midst of a series of severe financial crises involv-
ing large-scale use of IMF resources by a number of members, the CCL was
established by the IMF in 1999 as a means of preventing the spread of capi-
tal account–driven crises. The CCL is intended to provide members main-
taining strong policies with a precautionary line of defense against balance
of payments problems arising from international financial contagion.
Although it draws on IMF experience over several decades, the CCL has a
number of novel features that set it apart from other IMF lending instru-
ments, notably an element of pre-qualification and automaticity in using
IMF resources.
The CCL is subject to demanding eligibility requirements:
• the absence of an immediate need to use IMF resources at the time of
approval;
• a positive assessment of policies by the IMF, taking into account the
member’s adherence to internationally accepted standards (especially
the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard or SDDS);
• constructive relations with private creditors, with a view to facilitating
appropriate involvement of the private sector, and satisfactory manage-
ment of external vulnerability; and
