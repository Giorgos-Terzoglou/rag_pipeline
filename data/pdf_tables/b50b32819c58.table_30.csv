FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
• The IMF should continue to hold a relatively large amount of gold
among its assets, not only for prudential reasons, but also to meet
unforeseen contingencies.
• The IMF has a systemic responsibility to avoid causing disruptions to
the functioning of the gold market.
• Profits from any gold sales should be retained in an investment fund,
and only the investment income should be used for any purposes that
may be agreed upon by the IMF members.
The IMF’s Gold Since 1980
Uses of the IMF’s gold have occurred on two occasions since 1980 without
changing the IMF’s long-term holdings of gold. As was the case with the
open-market auctions of gold in 1976–80, these uses of gold were for the
benefit of the poorest members of the IMF. Toward this end, the IMF
pledged gold in 1993 and decided in 1999 to conduct off-market transactions
of gold.
Gold Pledge
To reassure creditors to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF) that they would be repaid for ESAF (now PRGF) loans made to
encash rights under the “rights accumulation approach,” it was agreed, if
necessary, to mobilize some of the IMF’s gold. For this purpose, in 1993 the
IMF decided—with the required 85 percent majority of the total voting
power—to sell up to 3 million ounces of gold if it were determined that the
resources in the PRGF Trust Reserve Account (plus other available means
of financing) were insufficient to meet payments to be made from that
account to PRGF creditors. The shortfall would be covered by gold sales to
the extent of previous drawings on the Reserve Account attributable to
overdue repayments by borrowers of loans for the encashment of rights, plus
the interest earnings forgone on such drawings.
It is difficult to assess the likelihood that the gold pledge for rights encash-
ments under PRGF arrangements would be drawn on in the future, mainly
because of uncertainty about future borrowings under the rights approach.
Sierra Leone and Zambia still have loans outstanding to the PRGF Trust
under the rights approach, but these loans are rapidly diminishing either
because they are coming close to maturity or because they are covered under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative. It is, therefore, highly unlikely that the gold
