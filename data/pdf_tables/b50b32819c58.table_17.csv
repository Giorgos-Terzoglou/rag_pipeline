BOX II.4. EARLY REPURCHASE POLICY: MINIMUM
REPURCHASE AMOUNTS
Formula
Under the guidelines for early repurchase, the minimum amount that a
member is expected to repurchase each quarter is determined by a formula
based on the member’s gross international reserves:
• 1.5 percent of latest reserves plus (minus)
• 5.0 percent of the increase (decrease) in reserves over the previous six
months.
For this purpose, the IMF uses the latest data on the member’s gross
reserves as reported in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics, with gold
valued at SDR 35 an ounce, available when the associated financial transac-
tions plan is prepared for Executive Board consideration. The formula thus
ensures a tight link between reserves and repayments to the IMF, with any
increase in reserves resulting in larger repurchases and vice versa. The formula
is applied anew for every quarter the member is included in the transactions
plan for early repurchases.
Limits
The minimum repurchase amount is subject to quantitative limits. This
amount cannot
• exceed 4 percent of latest reserves in a quarter,
• exceed 10 percent of latest reserves in a year, or
• reduce latest reserves below 250 percent of quota.
These limits are a means to protect members from having to draw too
heavily on their owned reserves to meet IMF repayments. In the two decades
since the policy was established, early repurchase amounts generated by the
formula have always fallen below these limits.
Credits
In addition to these limits, the minimum repurchase amount is reduced to
the extent of any repurchase obligations falling due during the quarter or to
give credit for voluntary advance repurchases:
• in the two quarters prior to the member being included for early repur-
chase, or
• subsequent repurchases in excess of minimum repurchase amounts.
The credits are intended to encourage members to accelerate repurchases
voluntarily on their own terms.
