of all members amounted to SDR 212.4 billion. A list of members and their
quotas is provided in Appendix I.
Members’ quotas constitute the financial base of the IMF and determine
its size, as well as serve other functions as determined by the IMF’s Articles.
• Quotas provide the vast bulk of reserve assets that can be used in the
provision of foreign reserves by the IMF, despite the availability of bor-
rowed resources and the growing role of administered resources to pro-
vide concessional assistance to the IMF’s poorest members.
• Quotas determine the distribution of voting power in the IMF.28 Quo-
tas determine members’ financial relationships with the IMF and,
through the effect on voting power, members’ roles in IMF decision-
making and representation on the Executive Board. Many decisions are
taken by a simple majority vote, though special voting majorities are
required for some important financial decisions (Appendix II).
• Quotas continue to play a crucial role in determining the demand for
IMF resources. Quotas serve as the basis for access to such resources in
the great majority of IMF-supported programs, subject to limits set by the
Articles and the Executive Board.29 Over the years, however, the rela-
tionship between quotas and access has become more elastic, especially
as the demand for IMF resources has become more unpredictable
because of the increased role of capital flows in balance of payments dise-
quilibria. Waivers of the Articles’ limits on access to IMF resources have
been granted where necessary to allow access in line with operational
requirements.
• Quotas also determine a member’s share in a general allocation of
SDRs.30
The initial quotas of the original members of the IMF were determined at
the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 (Schedule A of the IMF Articles);
those of subsequent members have been determined by the IMF’s Board of

SDR100,000 in quota. Basic votes therefore help to strengthen the relative voting power
of members with smaller quotas.
29While the IMF’s holdings of a member’s currency, which measure its access to IMF
credit, are restricted to no more than 200percent of quota under the Articles (Article V,
Section 3(b)(iii)), this limit—which amounts to IMF credit of 100 percent of quota—is rou-
tinely waived. See the discussion of “Access Policy” above.
