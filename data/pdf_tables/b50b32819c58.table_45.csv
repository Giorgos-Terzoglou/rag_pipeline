sharing” adjustments to the rate of charge and the rate of remuneration
(Box II.9). These allocations have amounted to 5 percent of GRA reserves
at the beginning of the year up until FY2001, when the allocation was
reduced to 3.3 percent. Balances in the SCA-1 are refundable to the contrib-
uting debtor and creditor member countries when all overdue obligations
have been settled, or earlier if the IMF so decides.41
The IMF’s objective to date has been to maintain a level of total precau-
tionary balances at least equal to credit to members in protracted arrears, a
goal that was first achieved in FY1993, and which has since been maintained.
41A second Special Contingent Account (SCA-2) was established as a safeguard against
possible losses arising from purchases made through the encashment of rights accumulated
under a rights accumulation program (RAP), and to provide additional liquidity for the
financing of those encashments (see Box II.9 and Chapter V). SCA-2 was terminated in
1999.
