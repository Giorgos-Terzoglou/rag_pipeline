begins after 4½ years, as with the obligation schedule, but repurchases are
doubled, so that the expectation schedule ends after 7 years rather than 10
years under the obligation schedule. Figure II.3 illustrates the mapping of
repurchase expectations and the corresponding repurchase obligations.
A member can request an extension of time-based repurchase expecta-
tions if its external position is not sufficiently strong. If the IMF agrees to an
extension, all repurchase expectations during the period covered by the
extension would revert back to the corresponding repurchase obligations.
There is a presumption that this period would be one year, although a longer
or shorter period could be set. If the IMF does not agree to an extension, the
member would be expected to make repurchases according to the expecta-
tion schedule. Failure to do so would result in a suspension of the right to
make further purchases, including prospective purchases under an existing
arrangement. However, the member would not be in arrears until it failed to
meet a repurchase obligation.
IMF-supported programs are guided by the requirement that the member
should be able to meet repurchase obligations. In most cases, therefore, mem-
bers will be considered to be in a position to meet repurchase expectations
only if their external position is stronger than had been projected at the time
of approval of the associated IMF arrangement. Similarly, the evaluation of
members’ capacity to repay the IMF is based on the obligation schedule.
An early repurchase policy serves as a backstop to the standard repur-
chase provisions. Members with IMF credit outstanding are normally
expected to make repurchases as their balance of payments and reserve
position improves.15 A member could experience an especially rapid and
strong turnaround in its balance of payments and reserve position, and may
be in a position to make repurchases earlier than under the fixed schedules
for time-based repurchase expectations. In addition, there are some pur-
chases for which time-based repurchase expectations are not applicable.16
Judgments on the appropriateness of early repurchases in individual cases
are made by the Executive Board. The amount of such repurchases expected
during a given quarter is determined on the basis of a formula that relies
heavily on gross reserves (BoxII.4).
15ArticleV, Section7(b).
16Time-based repurchase expectations do not apply to purchases made prior to Novem-
ber 2000 or to purchases under emergency assistance; separate repurchase expectations
apply to purchases under the CCL and SRF.
