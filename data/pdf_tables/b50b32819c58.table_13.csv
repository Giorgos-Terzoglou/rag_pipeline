BOX II.2. THE FRAMEWORK FOR ACCESS TO IMF RESOURCES
Quota-based access limits
• The credit tranches (mainly accessed through Stand-By Arrangements)
and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) are subject to the same access limits.
These consist of an annual limit of 100 percent of quota and a cumulative limit
of 300 percent of quota. The annual limit applies to gross purchases in any 12-
month period. The cumulative limit applies to credit outstanding, less sched-
uled repurchases, plus scheduled purchases, over the period of commitment of
resources. These limits may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Aver-
age annual access has been fairly stable at around half of the annual limit in
recent years (see Figure II.2).
• Access under the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) is subject to its
own limits. These limits are cumulative, and include limits of 45 percent of
quota each for access under the export shortfalls and excess cereal imports ele-
ments, and a combined limit of 55 percent of quota. These limits cannot be
exceeded.
• The amount of emergency assistance for natural disasters and for post-
conflict cases is limited, in any one instance, to 25 percent of quota. Larger
amounts can be made available on an exceptional basis in post-conflict cases.
Emergency assistance was until recently subject to the access limits under the
credit tranches but was converted into a facility and excluded from these
access limits, pending further review.
Access to other facilities
• The Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) is not subject to explicit access
limits. SRF resources are provided under Stand-By or Extended Arrange-
ments in addition to credit tranche or EFF resources, which are subject to
annual and cumulative limits. The IMF uses the same criteria for access to its
resources under all policies and facilities (see sectionon “General Terms and
Conditions”) but in the case of the SRF also takes into account the liquidity
position of the IMF, given the magnitude of the balance of payments need in
cases qualifying for this facility.
• The Contingent Credit Lines (CCLs) are not subject to access limits but
commitments under the CCL are expected to be in the range of 300–500 per-
cent of quota. CCL resources are provided under Stand-By Arrangements, in
combination with credit tranche resources up to the annual or the cumulative
limit. As with the SRF, the liquidity position of the IMF is taken into account
when determining access under the CCL.
