FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
Early repurchase expectations can arise in other contexts. Provisions for
early repurchase are built into the CFF, Contingent Credit Line (CCL), and
Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF). In addition, a member is required to
take corrective action by making an early repurchase in the event that it
makes a purchase under an arrangement that it was not entitled to make by
the terms of the arrangement—that is, a noncomplying purchase. The
requirement of corrective action can be waived if the IMF decides that the
circumstances justifycontinued use of the purchased resources. A noncom-
plying purchase would arise if a member were permitted to make a purchase
because, on the basis of information available at the time, the IMF was satis-
fied that the conditions applicable to the purchase under the arrangement
had been observed but, on the basis of information subsequently available, it
became evident that the conditions of the arrangement had not actually
been met.17
The IMF can change the period of repurchases.18 It has the authority to
postpone the date for the discharge of a repurchase by a majority of the
votes cast, provided that the postponement does not cause the repurchase to
exceed the maximum repurchase period. Postponement beyond the maxi-
mum period allowed under the arrangement would be considered only in
the event that the IMF determined that discharge on the due date would
result in exceptional hardship for the member and if the longer period for
repurchase is consistent with the revolving nature of the use of IMF
resources. Such a decision requires approval by a 70percent majority of the
total voting power.19
A member is free to make advance repurchases at any time. At the discre-
tion of the member, advance repurchases can be attributed to any outstand-
ing purchases. In this way, a member is free to reduce the IMF’s holdings of
its currency corresponding to prior purchases and thereby reduce or elimi-
nate its obligation to pay interest to the IMF. Repurchases can be made, at
the choice of the repurchasing member, in SDRs or in currencies selected by
the IMF according to the policies and procedures for the use and receipt of
17See also the discussion in Chapter V on “Measures to Deal with Misreporting.”
18An 85 percent majority of the total voting power in the IMF is required to change the
period of repurchase of holdings of currency acquired by the IMF pursuant to its policy on
the use of general resources. A 70 percent majority is required in the case of holdings of
currency not acquired as a result of purchases and subject to charges under Article V, Sec-
tion 8(b)(ii). See Appendix II.
19No such decision has been taken in the past 25 years.
