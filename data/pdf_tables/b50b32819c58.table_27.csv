Currency Holdings
In the balance sheet of the GRA, the IMF distinguishes between usable
currencies and other currencies. Usable currencies comprise the currencies
of those member countries that have a sufficiently strong balance of pay-
ments and reserve positions for their currencies to be used to provide credit
to other members. These currency holdings represent the bulk of resources
available to meet the future demand for IMF credit. Other currencies
include the currencies of members with weaker external positions that are
not being used for credit purposes, although they could become usable if the
members’ balance of payments positions improved, and the currencies of
borrowers.
Valuation of Currencies
Currencies and securities held in the GRA’s pool of resources are valued
in terms of the SDR on the basis of each member’s representative rate of
exchange. Each member is obligated to maintain, in SDR terms, the value of
the balances of the IMF’s holdings of its currency in the GRA, but not those
held elsewhere by the IMF, such as in the SDA or the Administered
Accounts.25 The total SDR value of the IMF’s holdings of currencies in the
GRA is kept constant through changes to the amount of members’ currency
balances. A member has to pay in additional currency if its currency depreci-
ates against the SDR, and the IMF will refund some of these currency hold-
ings if the currency appreciates. This requirement is referred to as the
maintenance-of-value obligation. Because of this obligation the IMF’s
resources are insulated from exchange rate fluctuations.
A member’s currency held by the IMF is revalued in SDR terms whenever:
• the currency is used by the IMF in a transaction with another member,
• at the end of the IMF’s financial year (April 30),
25Revaluation changes in members’ currencies in relation to the SDRin the other IMF
accounts (the SDA and the Administered Accounts) are reported as valuation gains and
losses for those accounts.
