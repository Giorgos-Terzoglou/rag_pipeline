FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
Income and Expenses
The amount added to reserves each year is the net income resulting from
the difference between operational income and operational and administra-
tive expenses.
Virtually all of the IMF’s operational income is derived from the charges
(interest on loans) that are levied on the outstanding use of credit in the
GRA. In addition to the basic rate of charge (i.e., the rate of charge before
burden sharing), the use of IMF credit under certain circumstances is subject
to surcharges, and all IMF credit is subject to service charges, commitment
fees on credit lines, and special charges (see Table II.2).42 A small amount of
income is also generated by receipts of interest on the IMF’s SDRholdings
(as explained in Chapter III).
Operational expenses consist of the remuneration (interest) paid on
remunerated reserve tranche positions, the allocation to the SCA-1, and the
payment of interest on outstanding IMF borrowing, if any. Net operational
income (operational income less operational expenses) is used to cover the
IMF’s administrative expenses, and the remainder constitutes net income
(Table II.6).43
Operational Income
The IMF aims to achieve a target level of net income each financial year
to add to its reserves.44 Based on the net income target, the SDR interest
rate, projected credit, and the outlook for administrative expenses, the IMF
estimates the basic rate of charge that is necessary to achieve the income tar-
get.45 The basic rate is set for the year as a proportion of the SDR interest
rate. For FY2001, this proportion was set at 115.9 percent.
42The IMF also has access to a relatively small amount of interest-free resources, includ-
ing its precautionary balances and the unremunerated portion of reserve tranche positions
of members.
43The Income Statement of the General Department also includes the income of the
SDA, which is discussed later in this chapter.
44The annual increase in reserves was set as 3 percent of reserves in the GRA at the
beginning of the year for financial years 1981–84, 5 percent for financial years 1985–99, 3.9
percent for financial year 2000, and 1.7 percent for financial years 2001–02. These figures
exclude income from surcharges.
45The procedure setting the basic rate of charge is governed by Rule I-6(4).
