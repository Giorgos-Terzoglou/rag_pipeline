FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
BOX II.5. EARLIER IMF LENDING INSTRUMENTS
Over the years, the IMF has established a number of policies and facilities to
meet particular balance of payments needs that were eventually either elimi-
nated or allowed to lapse:
• The Buffer Stock Financing Facility, created in 1969 and eliminated in
2000, provided financing to members to help finance their contributions to
approved commodity price stabilization funds.
• The first Oil Facility was created in June 1974 in response to the oil price
shock, and lapsed in December 1974. A second Oil Facility was created in April
1975 to provide additional financing, and lapsed in March 1976.
• A policy of support for debt and debt-service operations, initiated in 1989,
was a key element of the IMF’s response to the debt crisis. The policy proved
useful in facilitating commercial bank debt reduction but, by the late 1990s, had
outlived its usefulness and was discontinued in 2000.
• An oil import element was added to the Compensatory Financing Facility
(CFF) in November 1990, when oil prices rose sharply during the Middle East
conflict. It was allowed to lapse at end-1991.
• The Systemic Transformation Facility, created in April 1993 and allowed to
lapse in April 1995, provided support for the early stages of transition from
centrally planned to market economies, in relatively small amounts and with
relatively low conditionality.
• The policy on currency stabilization funds was established in 1995 as a
means of providing additional, precautionary support under IMF arrange-
ments during the early stage of an exchange rate–based stabilization program.
No member made use of the policy, and it was discontinued in 2000.
• A contingency element was added to the CFF in 1988. Until its elimination
in 2000, this instrument provided additional access under arrangements,
according to prespecified calculations, in the event of unanticipated adverse
current account developments.
• The Y2K Facility was created in September 1999 to deal with possible
strains resulting from the Millennium (Y2K) computer dating problem. It was
not used, and lapsed in March 2000.
Credit Tranche Policies
From its early history, IMF credit was made available in tranches (seg-
ments). Members could make purchases in four credit tranches, each equiva-
lent to 25percent of quota, within the prevailing annual access limit of 25
percent of quota and the cumulative access limit of 100percent of quota. A
