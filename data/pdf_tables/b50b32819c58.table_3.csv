FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
by a “repurchase” of its currency held by the IMF with SDRs or the currency
of another member.5
Members receive a liquid claim on the IMF (called a reserve, or reserve
tranche, position) for the reserve assets they provide to the IMF. This claim
earns a market-related rate of interest (called remuneration) and can be
encashed on demand to obtain reserve assets from the IMF. Consequently, a
member’s provision of reserve assets to the IMF changes the composition of
the member’s reserve assets—from, for example, U.S. dollars to claims on
the IMF—rather than the overall size of its international reserve assets. As
the borrower repays the IMF loan (repurchases its currency with reserve
assets), these funds are transferred to the creditor countries in exchange for
their currencies, and the creditor’s claim on the IMF is extinguished.
A member’s purchase of currency reduces the IMF’s holdings of the cur-
rency purchased, enlarges the reserve tranche position of the country whose
currency is purchased, and increases the IMF’s holdings of the purchasing
member’s currency. Charges (interest) are not levied on purchases within
the reserve tranche, as these resources are the member’s own reserves. Inter-
est is charged on the use of IMF credit, which is obtained through purchases
outside of the reserve tranche. A member can choose whether or not to use
its reserve tranche before utilizing IMF credit. Alternative financial posi-
tions of members in the IMF’s pool of resources in the GRA are illustrated
in Figure II.1.
The currency purchased from the IMF must be that of a member with a
strong external position, whose subscribed currency is considered usable for
IMF transactions. If the currency purchased is not freely usable, the member
whose currency is purchased is obliged to exchange purchased amounts of
its currency for freely usable currencies. If the purchased currency is freely
usable, the borrower can undertake transactions in the private exchange
markets or with the issuer of the freely usable currency to acquire a different
currency. A member whose currency is being used is obligated, if necessary,
to provide an amount of reserve assets of up to 100 percent of its quota. The
amount of reserve assets provided to the IMF has in practice fallen well
short of this maximum. In planning and executing members’ transactions,
members’ currencies are used in the financing of IMF credit according to
their relative quota shares. In turn, members’ currencies are used in effect-

tral banks before the IMF was established.
