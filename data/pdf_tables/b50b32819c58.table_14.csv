FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
policy measures that are considered necessary to resolve underlying balance
of payments problems and enable members to repay the IMF within the
established repurchase period. Phasing also enables the purchasing member
to demonstrate to other members that its adjustment program is being
implemented and warrants their continued support.
The choice between even phasing and uneven phasing depends on the bal-
ance of payments need and the path of adjustment. These choices are made
on a case-by-case basis: resources are normally fairly evenly spread over the
arrangement period but a concentration of adjustment at the beginning of
an arrangement could justify front-loading of purchases. The frequency of
purchases may also be affected by the length of lags in the reporting of data
relating to performance criteria.14
Repurchase Policies
The repurchase policies of the IMF are intended to ensure the revolving
character of its resources. All purchases made from the IMF are subject to
predetermined repurchase schedules (TableII.2). The length of the repur-
chase period and the number of repurchase installments differ according to
the policy or facility under which the credit was extended.
In the case of most purchases, a borrower is expected to repurchase ear-
lier than the schedule of repurchase obligations. Such time-based repurchase
expectations are aimed at securing early repayment from members in a posi-
tion to do so, in keeping with a long-standing principle of the IMF that its
resources should be used only as long as there is a balance of payments need
(BoxII.3). A waiver of early repurchase expectations can be provided by
the Executive Board upon the request of a member, if the member’s exter-
nal position is not strong enough for the member to pay early without undue
hardship or risk. In case of a waiver, repurchases would fall due according to
the original obligation schedule.
Time-based repurchase expectations apply to purchases made after
November 28, 2000 in the credit tranches and under the CFF and EFF. For
purchases in the credit tranches and under the CFF, the expectation schedule
is 1 year in advance of the obligation schedule, beginning 2¼ years after each
purchase and ending after 4 years. For the EFF, the expectation schedule
14Specific guidelines on phasing are set out in Selected Decisions and Selected Docu-
ments of the International Monetary Fund (Washington). This volume is updated annually
on June 30. See, for example, the Twenty-Fifth Issue, June 30, 2000.
