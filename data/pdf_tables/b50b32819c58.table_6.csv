ing receipts to the IMF in a manner that adjusts reserve tranche positions
toward a uniform proportion of their quotas.6
The purchase-repurchase mechanism explains why, from an accounting
perspective, the IMF’s total resources do not vary as a result of the IMF’s
financial assistance—only the composition of its assets change. Moreover,
the value of members’ currencies held in the GRA’s pool of resources is
maintained in SDR terms over time through periodic additions to the
amounts of currencies that are depreciating against the SDR and reductions
from those that are appreciating against the SDR. This maintenance of value
provision is an obligation of members under the Articles.7
Special Disbursement Account
The Special Disbursement Account (SDA) is the vehicle for receiving and
investing profits from the sale of the IMF’s gold (i.e., the net proceeds in
excess of the book value of SDR35 a fine ounce), and for making transfers
to other accounts for special purposes authorized in the Articles, in particu-
lar for financial assistance to low-income members of the IMF.
Investment Account
The IMF is authorized to establish an Investment Account in the General
Department; to date, however, no decision has been taken to this effect.
Investments of amounts up to the level of accumulated reserves may be
made only in income-generating marketable obligations of international
financial organizations or of the member whose currency is used for the
investment.8 The income may be reinvested or used to meet the expenses of
conducting the business of the IMF, including both operational and adminis-
trative expenses.
6For an analysis of the key elements underlying the GRA’s costs and revenues and past
proposals for simplification or modification, see “Financing the Fund’s Operations—
Review of Issues,” March 2000, on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/
ffo/2001/fin.htm).
7Article V, Section 11(a).
8The resources in the GRA are managed in such a way as to lower the IMF’s costs or to
increase the IMF’s revenue. In order to be more profitable than GRA resources, resources
in an Investment Account would need to be invested at a rate that exceeds the SDR inter-
est rate after taking into account any exchange risk.
