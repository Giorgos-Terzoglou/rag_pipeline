are included for receipts (repayments) from borrowing members; receipts in
SDRs are not managed through the plan as the IMF has little or no discre-
tion over their use by members. The total amount for transfers in the trans-
actions plan is based on the expected volume of credit to be extended to
members and operational payments by the IMF (such as interest on official
borrowing by the IMF) during the plan period. Receipts in currencies are
estimated on the basis of the schedule of forthcoming repayments and the
preferences of members with respect to the media of payment (i.e., curren-
cies versus SDRs).
