FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
Operational Expenses
The IMF pays remuneration (interest) on members’ reserve tranche posi-
tions equal to the SDR interest rate, except on a small portion, as indicated
earlier (see section on “Reserve Tranche Positions”).46 Remuneration pay-
ments account for almost all of IMF operational expenses when there is no
outstanding IMF borrowing. If borrowing is outstanding, the IMF also pays
interest on it. The interest rate on borrowing under the General Arrange-
ments to Borrow (GAB) is equal to the SDR interest rate, while under the
New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), it may be equal to or higher than the
SDR interest rate, as explained below under “Borrowing.”
Administrative Expenses
The IMF’s administrative expenses can be divided into personnel, travel,
building occupancy, and other such costs. Personnel and travel-related out-
lays typically account for about 80 percent of total administrative expenses.
The GRA is reimbursed for the cost of administering the SDR Department
through an assessment levied in proportion to each participant’s allocation
of SDRs. The GRA is also to be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in
administering the PRGF Trust. However, following the establishment of the
SRF and the consequent increase in net income, this reimbursement has
been forgone and the amount that would otherwise have been reimbursed
has been transferred to the PRGF-HIPC Trust. This arrangement has been
in place since 1998 and is expected to continue up to 2004.
Borrowing
The IMF can borrow to supplement its quota resources. It maintains two
standing borrowing arrangements with official lenders and can borrow from
private markets, although it has not done so to date. Borrowing has played
an important role in providing temporary, supplemental resources to the
IMF at critical junctures in the past (TableII.7). In recent years, the borrow-
ing arrangements with official lenders have been enlarged and their partici-
pation broadened, strengthening IMF liquidity.
46(cid:1)The basic (unadjusted) rate of remuneration has been equal to the SDR interest rate
since February 1, 1987. However, refundable adjustments to that rate are made under
“burden sharing.” The Articles require that the rate of remuneration be maintained in the
range of 80–100 percent of the SDR interest rate. The current relationship between the
rate of remuneration and the SDR interest rate is governed by Rule I-10.
