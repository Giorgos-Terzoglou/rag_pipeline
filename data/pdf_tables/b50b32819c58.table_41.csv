Since 1970, there have been only four ad hoc increases in quotas outside
the framework of a general review. Ad hoc increases in the quotas of China
in 1980 and of Cambodia in 1994 were associated with the change in repre-
sentation of the member in the IMF (China) and the resumption of active
relations with the IMF (Cambodia), as China’s initial quota had never been
increased and Cambodia’s quota had not been increased since 1970. Saudi
Arabia received an ad hoc increase in 1981. A major factor underlying Saudi
Arabia’s ad hoc increase was the desire to strengthen the IMF’s liquidity
position during the developing country debt crisis before the Eighth Review
had been completed. China also received an ad hoc quota increase in 2001 to
better reflect its position in the world economy following its resumption of
exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong. For each of the post-1969 cases, the
quota formulas played a role in determining the extent of the ad hoc
increase.
Role of the Quota Formulas
In practice, the role of the quota formulas in determining actual quotas
and quota share adjustments has been quite limited. As noted above, quota
increases in the context of general reviews have been distributed largely on
the basis of a uniform proportionate increase in actual quotas. The continu-
ing significant difference between actual and calculated quota shares
reflects:
• the Executive Board’s view that general quota reviews should provide
all members with an adequate increase in quota;
• a general reluctance to make politically difficult quota share adjust-
ments; and
• widespread dissatisfaction with formulas that were viewed as overly
complex, lacking in transparency, and not representative of actual con-
ditions in the world economy.
In 1999, the IMF established an external panel of independent experts, the
Quota Formula Review Group (QFRG), to assess the adequacy of the for-
mulas used to guide the determination of quotas and to make recommenda-
tions for reforms that would take account of changes in the world economy
and the international financial system and the increasing globalization of
markets. The eight member panel, chaired by Professor Richard Cooper of
Harvard University, submitted a report that was considered by the Executive
