BOX II.9. THE BURDEN-SHARING MECHANISM
Since1986, the burden-sharing mechanism has made up for the loss of
income from unpaid charges and has been used to accumulate resources in two
Special Contingent Accounts (SCAs). The mechanism works by providing for
additions and deductions to the rates of charge and remuneration, respectively.
Resources collected from individual members under the mechanism are
refundable to them as arrears cases are resolved, or as may be decided by the
IMF. Thus, resources collected for unpaid charges are refunded when these
charges are eventually settled. At end-April 2001, cumulative deferred charges
that were subject to burden sharing amounted to SDR1,796million and settle-
ments of unpaid charges of SDR993million had been made and refunded.
Of the two Special Contingent Accounts, the first, SCA-1, was established
specifically to protect against the financial impact of arrears in general. The
second, SCA-2, collected resources (1) to finance the encashment of “rights”
earned by eligible members in arrears to later draw on IMF resources, and
(2)to safeguard against the risk of loss arising from purchases made in connec-
tion with the encashment of rights. SCA-2 was terminated in1999, and the bal-
ances in the account refunded, after it was concluded that other precautionary
balances in the GRA provided adequate protection against the risks associ-
ated with rights-related credit. The termination of SCA-2 was also part of an
overall agreement on the financing of the PRGF (then ESAF) and HIPC initi-
atives, for which it was envisaged that some members would voluntarily con-
tribute resources refunded from SCA-2.
In the aggregate, creditor and debtor members have contributed equal
amounts for unpaid charges and for allocations to the SCA-1, whereas credi-
tors provided three-fourths of the amounts contributed to the SCA-2. A total
of SDR1.2billion had been accumulated in the SCA-1 at end-April 2001. A
total of SDR1billion was accumulated during the operation of the SCA-2
in1990–97.
In addition, to protect itself against general credit risk, the IMF has estab-
lished a target for precautionary balances in excess of overdue credit. The
target range for these “free reserves” is 3–5percent of the amount of out-
standing “credit in good standing.” Free reserves had risen to 8.0 percent of
credit in good standing at end-April 2001 (see Table II.5).
