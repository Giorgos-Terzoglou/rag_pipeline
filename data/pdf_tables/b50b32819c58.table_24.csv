• a satisfactory economic and financial program, which the member
stands ready to adjust as needed.
As with the SRF, CCL resources are provided under Stand-By Arrange-
ments, in combination with credit tranche resources. Access to CCL resources
is expected to be in the range of 300–500percent of quota, and does not count
toward the access limits for the credit tranches and the EFF.
Upon approval of an arrangement with CCL resources, a small amount is
made available but is not expected to be purchased. If a crisis strikes, the
member may request the completion of an activation review, at which the
Executive Board would ascertain that the member is affected by a crisis
stemming from contagion and that the member’s own policies had not been
a significant cause of the pressures in its balance of payments. There is a pre-
sumption that one-third of the amount committed under the CCL would be
released at this time. The phasing and conditionality for the remaining CCL
resources would be specified in a post-activation review concluded shortly
after or together with the activation review; conditionality would be
expected to cover macroeconomic rather than structural policies, given the
nature of the balance of payments difficulties.
The financial terms for CCL resources are identical to those governing
SRF resources, except that the surcharge on CCL resources over the basic
rate of charge is 150basis points lower: the CCL surcharge is 150basis
points initially, rising by 50basis points one year after the first purchase and
every six months thereafter, up to a maximum surcharge of 350basis points.
The commitment fee for the CCL is the same as for the SRF.
Compensatory Financing Facility
The CFF was the first facility aimed at helping members deal with special
balance of payments problems. It was established in the 1960s to ensure
timely external financing for members experiencing balance of payments
difficulties resulting from a temporary decline in export earnings. A cereal
import element was added in 1981; two other elements introduced since the
establishment of the CFF have been removed (see BoxII.5). In addition to
having a balance of payments need related to export shortfalls or excess
cereal import costs, the eligibility requirements include the following:
• the export shortfall or excess cereal import cost are of a short-term
character;
• the shortfall or excess must be largely attributable to factors beyond the
member’s control; and
