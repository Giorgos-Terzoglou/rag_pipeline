normally transferable to other official holders, which provides some
protection to the IMF’s liquidity.
• Interest rates. In the early years of the IMF, interest rates on IMF bor-
rowing and charges on purchases financed by borrowed resources were
very low. Following the introduction of remuneration with the First
Amendment of the Articles of Agreement in 1969, more attention was
paid to the rate of return on the reserves that members made available to
the IMF. Market rates were increasingly seen by members as the oppor-
tunity cost of lending to the IMF. In line with market practice, borrowing
agreements since 1977 have provided for floating interest rates. To pro-
tect the IMF’s income position, the cost of borrowing plus a small margin
has been reflected in the rate of charge on the use of borrowed resources.
Management of Financial Resources
and the Liquidity Position
As noted above, not all of the IMF’s resources are immediately available
for lending. The IMF’s usable resources consist of currencies of IMF mem-
bers with a strong balance of payments position and SDRs, which stem
mainly from quota payments. The institution maintains substantial holdings
of gold and other fixed assets, but these are not used in lending operations.
Borrowing by the IMF to finance the extension of credit through the GRA is
an important complement to the use of its quota resources but remains the
exception rather than the rule. Borrowing is, however, a central feature of
IMF lending under the PRGF, as discussed in ChapterIV.
The usability of the IMF’s currency holdings varies over time. In principle,
the currencies of all members are available for use in IMF transactions.
Members have an obligation to convert balances of their currency purchased
from the IMF by other members into one of the four freely usable curren-
cies: the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the pound sterling.47
The IMF determines which members are in a sufficiently strong external
position to meet this currency exchange obligation when drawing up its
quarterly financial transactions plan (see below). The currencies of these
