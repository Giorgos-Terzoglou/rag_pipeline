FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
The GAB enable the IMF to borrow specified amounts of currencies from
11 industrial countries or their central banks, under certain circumstances, at
market-related rates of interest (TableII.8). The potential amount of credit
available to the IMF under the GAB is SDR 17 billion, with an additional
SDR 1.5 billion available under an associated agreement with Saudi Arabia.
The GAB are reviewed and renewed regularly. A broad review of the
GAB was undertaken in 1983, at the outset of the developing country debt
crisis. The most important changes to emerge from that review were the sub-
stantial enlargement of the GAB to its present size (from about SDR6 bil-
lion), the addition of SDR1.5 billion under the associated agreement with
Saudi Arabia, and the change to permit use of the GAB to finance IMF
lending to nonparticipants in the GAB if the IMF faces an inadequacy of
resources. Since 1983, the GAB and the associated agreement with Saudi
Arabia have been renewed every four or five years without further modifi-
cation, most recently for a further five-year period from December26, 1998.
The GAB have been activated ten times. The GAB were last activated in
July 1998 for an amount of SDR 6.3 billion (SDR 1.4 billion of which was
drawn) in connection with the financing of an Extended Arrangement for
Russia. The activation for Russia was canceled in March 1999, when the IMF
repaid the outstanding amount following the coming into effect of the Elev-
enth General Review of Quotas and payment of the bulk of the quota
increases. Prior to the activation for Russia, the most recent activation
occurred in 1977, when the IMF borrowed for lending to the United Kingdom
and Italy under Stand-By Arrangements, and in 1978 to finance a reserve
tranche purchase by the United States. A proposal for calls on the GAB by
the IMF’s Managing Director can become effective only if it is accepted by the
GAB participants, and the proposal is then approved by the Executive Board.
The IMF also has New Arrangements to Borrow to deal with financial cri-
ses. Following the Mexican financial crisis in December 1994, concern that
substantially more resources might be needed to respond to future financial
crises prompted participants in the June 1995 Group of Seven Halifax Sum-
mit to call on the Group of Ten and other financially strong countries to
develop financing arrangements that would double the amount available to
the IMF under the GAB. The NAB became effective on November 17, 1998.
The NAB effectively double the resources available under the GAB. The
NAB are a set of credit arrangements between the IMF and 25 members and
institutions to provide supplementary resources to the IMF to forestall or
cope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to deal
with an exceptional situation to the stability of that system. The NAB do not
