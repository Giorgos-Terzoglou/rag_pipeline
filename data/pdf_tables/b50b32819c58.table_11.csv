the use of the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) is restricted to tempo-
rary balance of payments deficits arising from overall export shortfalls or
increased costs of specified cereal imports.
Access Policy
The policy of the IMF is to encourage members to approach it for assis-
tance at an early stage of their balance of payments difficulties. Members
experiencing balance of payments problems can approach the IMF, but are
under no obligation to do so at any time. Over the years, it has come to be
recognized that the efficacy of the mixture of adjustment polices and financ-
ing depends largely on the early adoption of corrective policy measures.
Early resort to an adjustment program supported by IMF resources can help
to avoid more drastic policy actions that may otherwise be required, thereby
limiting the impact of the adjustment on other members.
Quantitative limits on access are used to ensure equal treatment of mem-
bers. Access limits are set in terms of quota, the basic measure of members’
financial rights and obligations in the IMF. For the credit tranches and the
EFF, which account for the lion’s share of IMF lending, the current limits
take the form of an annual limit of 100 percent of quota on purchases over
any 12-month period and a cumulative limit of 300 percent of quota on the
level of IMF credit outstanding. Average annual access under these lending
arrangements in recent years has been 40–50 percent of quota (Figure II.2).
Other IMF facilities are subject to separate access limits or, in some cases,
no explicit limits (Box II.2). In exceptional circumstances, these limits can be
waived, as they were for members most immediately affected by the severe
financial crises of the late 1990s.
The level of access to GRA resources under Stand-By Arrangements and
the EFF—that is, the amount that can be borrowed—is based on criteria
that are applied uniformly to all members. These criteria seek to balance the
needs of members against the overarching responsibility of the institution to
safeguard and ensure the temporary use of its resources. The criteria are:
• actual or potential need for resources from the IMF, taking into account
other sources of financing and the desirability of maintaining a reason-
able level of reserves;
• ability to service indebtedness to the IMF, thereby protecting the
revolving character of IMF resources;
• amount of the outstanding use of IMF credit and record in using IMF
resoures in the past.
