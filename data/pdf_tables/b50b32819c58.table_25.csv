• if the member has balance of payments difficulties beyond the effect of
the shortfall or excess, it must have a new or existing arrangement in
place at the time of the request for a CFF purchase.
Access under the CFF is subject to its own limits, and does not count
toward the access limits under the credit tranches and the EFF. The CFF
access limits range from 45percent of quota for each of the export shortfall
and excess cereal import costs elements to a combined limit of 55percent of
quota. Within these limits, actual access is determined by the size of the
shortfall or excess, and may be limited by concerns about the member’s abil-
ity to repay the IMF. Access under the CFF counts toward the threshold for
upper credit tranche conditionality—that is, the CFF does not “float” as
regards conditionality.24
Under certain circumstances, purchases under the CFF may be phased,
with purchases subsequent to the initial purchase being conditioned on the
member’s having an IMF arrangement in place and meeting all the condi-
tions for a purchase or disbursement under that arrangement. They are sub-
ject to the same terms as credit tranche resources with respect to charges,
repurchase expectations, and repurchase obligations; CFF purchases do not
carry a surcharge, however, and do not count toward the calculation of sur-
charges applying to IMF credit outstanding in excess of 200percent of
quota.
In addition to the time-based early repurchase expectations, the CFF
incorporates additional specific early repurchase provisions. If a member
makes a purchase on the basis of estimated data for the shortfall in export
earnings or excess in cereal import costs, and if the actual data, once they are
available, indicate that the purchase exceeded the amount that would have
been available had actual data been used, the member is expected to repur-
chase promptly an amount equivalent to the difference.
Emergency Assistance
The IMF has a long-standing policy of providing financial assistance to
members experiencing emergencies. The conditionality associated with IMF
lending for this purpose is similar to that required for purchases in the first
24In practice, this means that a member with 25percent of quota or more of credit out-
standing under the CFF cannot access the credit tranches with first credit tranche (lower)
conditionality.
