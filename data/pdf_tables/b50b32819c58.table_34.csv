FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF
Governors, based on principles consistent with those applied to existing
members. The IMF has adjusted quotas within the context of five-yearly
general reviews and on an ad hoc basis outside of general reviews. An
85percent majority of voting power is needed to change quotas.
The determination of the quota of a new member of the IMF is based on
the principle that a member’s quota should be in the same range as the quo-
tas of existing members of comparable economic size and characteristics.
Operationally, this principle has been applied through the use of quota for-
mulas. Since the IMF’s inception, the calculated quotas derived from the
quota formulas have been used to help guide decisions regarding the size
and distribution of members’ actual quotas.
Quota formulas have evolved over time starting from the formula—contain-
ing national income, official reserves, imports, export variability, and the ratio of
exports to national income—that was devised at Bretton Woods in 1944 to give
support to the broad configuration of initial quotas that was being negotiated.
A multiformula approach was adopted in the early 1960s, when the Bret-
ton Woods formula was revised and supplemented by four other formulas
containing the same basic variables but with larger weights for external
trade and export variability. The Bretton Woods formula, with its relatively
high weight for national income, has generally favored large economies,
while the additional four formulas have tended to produce higher quotas
than the Bretton Woods formula for smaller, more open economies. The five
formulas, which are listed in Box II.7, were last modified in 1982–83.
General Reviews
The IMF conducts general reviews of all members’ quotas normally at five
year intervals.31 Such reviews allow the IMF to assess the adequacy of quo-
tas in terms of members’ needs for conditional liquidity and the IMF’s abil-
ity to finance those needs. A general review also allows for adjustments of
members’ quotas to reflect changes in their relative positions in the world
economy. Of the general reviews conducted to date, only one (in 1958/59)
was outside the five-year cycle.
The main issues addressed in general quota reviews are the size of an
overall increase in quotas and the distribution of the increase among the
31Article III, Section 2(a).
