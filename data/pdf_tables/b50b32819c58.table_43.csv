one or more freely usable currencies by drawing on the IMF (Box II.8). A
member is obligated, if necessary, to provide an amount of reserve assets of
up to 100 percent of its quota. The amount of reserve assets provided to the
IMF has in practice fallen well below this maximum (Figure II.5).
The IMF pays interest, called remuneration, on a member’s reserve posi-
tion in the IMF, except on a small portion that is provided to the IMF as an
interest-free resource. This unremunerated (non-interest-bearing) portion
of the reserve tranche position is equal to 25 percent of the member’s quota
on April 1, 1978—that part of the quota that was paid in gold prior to the
Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles. The gold tranche was never
remunerated historically, so it was natural to set aside this same amount in
terms of SDRs on this date as the unremunerated reserve tranche. For a
member that joined the IMF after that date, the unremunerated reserve
tranche is the same percentage of its initial quota as the average unremuner-
ated reserve tranche was as a percentage of the quotas of all other members
when the new member joined the IMF. The unremunerated reserve tranche
remains fixed for each member in nominal terms, but because of subsequent
quota increases, it is now significantly lower when expressed as a percentage
of quota.39 The average is equal to 3.8 percent, but the actual percentage is
different for each member.
Precautionary Balances
The IMF’s resources in the GRA increase through additions to its precau-
tionary balances, which comprise reserves and balances that have been set
aside in the first Special Contingent Account (SCA-1). The level and rate of
accumulation of precautionary balances reflect the IMF’s assessment of the
risk of future operational deficits and general credit risk, including that aris-
39In the past, the proportion of the reserve tranche that was remunerated was sometimes
related to the concept of the “norm” for remuneration, which was calculated as the total of
(1) 75 percent of a member’s quota before the Second Amendment, plus (2) any subse-
quent increases in quota. For a country that became a member after April 1, 1978, the
norm is a percentage of its quota equal to the weighted average relative to quota of the
norms applicable to all other members on the date that the member joined the IMF, plus
the amounts of any increases in its quota afterward. At each quota increase, a member’s
norm rises, becoming closer to 100 percent of its quota. The remunerated reserve tranche
excludes certain holdings: all currency holdings acquired when the member used IMF
resources, and currency holdings in the IMF No. 2 Account that are less than 1⁄ 10 of 1 per-
cent of the member’s quota. See the section on “IMF Accounts in Member Countries.”
