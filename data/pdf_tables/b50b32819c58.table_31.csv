pledge would be activated in connection with these loans. Moreover, the
gold pledge could not be called upon until after the resources of the Reserve
Account of the PRGF Trust were exhausted.26 Nevertheless, three coun-
tries—Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan—remain eligible for the rights
approach and could conceivably borrow sizable sums from the PRGF in con-
nection with rights encashments at some time in the future, provided the
Executive Board continues to extend the availability of the rights approach.
Whether these countries will follow the rights approach to arrears clearance
is uncertain. In any case, the earliest rights encashments could not take place
for a few years and repayment of those PRGF loans would only commence
five and half years after such disbursements.
Off-Market Transactions in Gold
To help finance its contribution to the HIPC Initiative, the IMF in 1999–
2000 conducted a series of off-market transactions in gold. During December
1999–April 2000, the IMF sold a total of 12.944 million fine ounces of gold to
Brazil and Mexico at the prevailing market price on the day of each transac-
tion. The total amount sold was equivalent to SDR 2.7 billion ($3.7billion).
After each sale, the gold was immediately accepted back by the IMF at the
same price in settlement of financial obligations of these members to the
IMF. The net effect of these transactions left the IMF’s holdings of physical
gold unchanged, but the gold accepted back was included in the IMF’s bal-
ance sheet at the market price of the transactions, instead of at the original
price of SDR 35 a fine ounce.
In accordance with the Articles, the equivalent of SDR 35 a fine ounce
from the proceeds of the sales was retained in the GRA. The proceeds in
excess of this amount (totaling SDR 2.2 billion, or about $2.9 billion) are
held in the SDA and invested. The income from these investments, which
will be transferred to the PRGF-HIPC Trust when needed, will be used to
help finance the IMF’s contribution to the HIPC Initiative. In this context,
the Board of Governors of the IMF adopted a resolution in September 1999
stating that the off-market gold transactions would “be a one-time operation
of a highly exceptional nature.”
These gold transactions affected the IMF’s balance sheet and income as
follows:
