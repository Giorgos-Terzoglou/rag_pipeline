It presents analyses and projections of the world economy in the near and medium term, which are integral elements of the IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member  and of the global economic system. They consider issues affecting advanced, emerging and developing economies, and address topics of pressing current interest.

This reflects front-loading ahead of tariffs, lower effective tariff rates, better financial conditions, and fiscal expansion in some major jurisdictions. Global inflation is expected to fall, but US inflation is predicted to stay above target. Downside risks from potentially higher tariffs, elevated uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions persist. Restoring confidence, predictability, and sustainability remains a key policy priority. World Economic Outlook, April 2025: A Critical Juncture amid Policy Shifts April 22, 2025 Description: A Critical Juncture amid Policy Shifts The latest World Economic Outlook reports a slowdown in global growth as downside risks intensify. While policy shifts unfold and uncertainties reach new highs, policies need to be calibrated to rebalance growth-inflation trade-offs, rebuild buffers, and reinvigorate medium-term growth, thereby reducing both internal and external imbalances. Policies that promote healthy aging, bridge gender disparities, and enhance the alignment of migrants’ skills with local labor market demands can play a crucial role in countering slow economic growth and fiscal pressures, especially when coupled with infrastructure investment. World Economic Outlook Update, January 2025: Global Growth: Divergent and Uncertain January 17, 2025 Description: Global Growth: Divergent and Uncertain Global growth is projected at 3.3 percent both in 2025 and 2026, broadly unchanged from the October 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast with an upward revision in the United States offsetting downward revisions elsewhere. The near-term outlook is characterized by divergent paths, while medium-term risks to growth are tilted to the downside. Renewed inflationary pressures could interrupt the monetary policy pivot, with implications for fiscal sustainability and financial stability. The policy mix should balance trade-offs and rebuild buffers. 2024 World Economic Outlook, October 2024: Policy Pivot, Rising Threats October 22, 2024 Description: Policy Pivot, Rising Threats The latest World Economic Outlook reports stable but underwhelming global growth, with the balance of risks tilted to the downside. As monetary policy is eased amid continued disinflation, shifting gears is needed to ensure that fiscal policy is on a sustainable path and to rebuild fiscal buffers. Understanding the role of monetary policy in recent global disinflation, and the factors that influence the social acceptability of structural reforms, will be key to promoting stable and more rapid growth in the future. World Economic Outlook Update, July 2024: The Global Economy in a Sticky Spot July 16, 2024 Description: The Global Economy in a Sticky Spot Global growth is projected to be in line with the April 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast, at 3.2 percent in 2024 and 3.3 percent in 2025. Services inflation is holding up progress on disinflation, which is complicating monetary policy normalization. Upside risks to inflation have thus increased, raising the prospect of higher for even longer interest rates, in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty. The policy mix should thus be sequenced carefully to achieve price stability and replenish diminished buffers. World Economic Outlook, April 2024: Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence April 16, 2024 Description: Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence The baseline forecast is for the world economy to continue growing at 3.2 percent during 2024 and 2025, at the same pace as in 2023. A slight acceleration for advanced economies—where growth is expected to rise from 1.6 percent in 2023 to 1.7 percent in 2024 and 1.8 percent in 2025—will be offset by a modest slowdown in emerging market and developing economies from 4.3 percent in 2023 to 4.2 percent in both 2024 and 2025. The forecast for global growth five years from now—at 3.1 percent—is at its lowest in decades. Global inflation is forecast to decline steadily, from 6.8 percent in 2023 to 5.9 percent in 2024 and 4.5 percent in 2025, with advanced economies returning to their inflation targets sooner than emerging market and developing economies. Core inflation is generally projected to decline more gradually. The global economy has been surprisingly resilient, despite significant central bank interest rate hikes to restore price stability. Chapter 2 explains that changes in mortgage and housing markets over the prepandemic decade of low interest rates moderated the near-term impact of policy rate hikes. Chapter 3 focuses on medium-term prospects and shows that the lower predicted growth in output per person stems, notably, from persistent structural frictions preventing capital and labor from moving to productive firms. Chapter 4 further indicates how dimmer prospects for growth in China and other large emerging market economies will weigh on trading partners. World Economic Outlook Update, January 2024: Moderating Inflation and Steady Growth Open Path to Soft Landing January 30, 2024 Description: Global growth is projected to stay at 3.1 percent in 2024 and rise to 3.2 percent in 2025. Elevated central bank rates to fight inflation and a withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt weigh on economic activity. Inflation is falling faster than expected in most regions, amid unwinding supply-side issues and restrictive monetary policy. Global headline inflation is expected to fall to 5.8 percent in 2024 and 4.4 percent in 2025, with the 2025 forecast having been revised down. 2023 World Economic Outlook, October 2023: Navigating Global Divergences October 10, 2023 Description: The latest World Economic Outlook reports signs that policy tightening is starting to cool activity despite core inflation proving persistent. Risks are more balanced as banking sector stress has receded, but they remain tilted to the downside. World Economic Outlook Update, July 2023: Near-Term Resilience, Persistent Challenges July 25, 2023 Description: Global growth is projected to fall from an estimated 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3.0 percent in both 2023 and 2024. The rise in central bank policy rates to fight inflation continues to weigh on economic activity. Global headline inflation is expected to fall from 8.7 percent in 2022 to 6.8 percent in 2023 and 5.2 percent in 2024. Underlying (core) inflation is projected to decline more gradually, and forecasts for inflation in 2024 have been revised upward. World Economic Outlook, April 2023: A Rocky Recovery April 11, 2023 Description: The baseline forecast is for growth to fall from 3.4 percent in 2022 to 2.8 percent in 2023, before settling at 3.0 percent in 2024. Advanced economies are expected to see an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from 2.7 percent in 2022 to 1.3 percent in 2023. In a plausible alternative scenario with further financial sector stress, global growth declines to about 2.5 percent in 2023 with advanced economy growth falling below 1 percent. Global headline inflation in the baseline is set to fall from 8.7 percent in 2022 to 7.0 percent in 2023 on the back of lower commodity prices but underlying (core) inflation is likely to decline more slowly. Inflation’s return to target is unlikely before 2025 in most cases.

It also provides precautionary financing to help prevent and insure against crises. The IMF’s lending toolkit is continuously refined to meet ’ changing needs. What kind of financial assistance does the IMF offer? Unlike development banks, the IMF does not lend for specific projects. Instead, the IMF provides financial support to  hit by crises to create breathing room as they implement policies that restore economic stability and growth. It also provides precautionary financing to help prevent crises. IMF lending is continuously refined to meet ’ changing needs. IMF lending at-a-glance Why do crises occur? The causes of crises are varied and complex. They can be domestic, external, or both. Domestic factors include inappropriate fiscal and monetary policies, which can lead to large current account and fiscal deficits and high public debt levels; an exchange rate fixed at an inappropriate level, which can erode competitiveness and result in the loss of official reserves, and a weak financial system, which can create economic booms and busts. Political instability and weak institutions also can trigger crises. External factors include shocks ranging from natural disasters to large swings in commodity prices. Both are common causes of crises, especially for low-income . With globalization, sudden changes in market sentiment can result in capital flow volatility. Even  with sound fundamentals can be severely affected by economic crises and policies elsewhere. The COVID-19 pandemic was an example of external shock affecting  across the globe. The IMF responded with unprecedented financial assistance to help  protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. Crises can take many different forms. For instance: Balance of payment problems occur when a nation is unable to pay for essential imports or service its external debt. Financial crises stem from illiquid or insolvent financial institutions. Fiscal crises are caused by excessive deficits and debt. Often,  that come to the IMF face more than one type of crisis as challenges in one sector spread throughout the economy. Crises can slow growth, increase unemployment, lower incomes, and create uncertainty, leading to a deep recession. In an acute crisis, defaults or restructuring of sovereign debt may be unavoidable. The IMF provides financial assistance and works with governments to ensure responsible spending. The IMF offers various types of loans that are tailored to ' different needs and specific circumstances. How IMF lending helps IMF lending gives  breathing room to adjust policies in an orderly manner, paving the way for a stable economy and sustainable growth. Policy adjustments will vary depending on the country’s circumstances. For example, a country facing a sudden drop in the price of key exports may need financial assistance while moving to strengthen its economy and diversify its exports. A country facing severe capital outflows may need to restore investor confidence by addressing the problems that led to capital flight —perhaps interest rates are too low, the budget deficit and debt are growing too fast, or the banking system is inefficient or poorly regulated. Without timely IMF financing, a country’s adjustment process may be more abrupt and difficult. For example, if investors are unwilling to provide new financing, the country may suffer a painful compression of government spending, imports, and economic activity. IMF financing facilitates a more gradual adjustment. Because IMF lending usually is accompanied by a set of corrective policy actions, it signals that appropriate policies are being put in place, encouraging the return of private investors. IMF lending also aims to protect the most vulnerable population via policy conditionality. In low-income , IMF lending is also typically meant to catalyze financial support from other donors and development partners. The IMF lending process is flexible.  that maintain a commitment to sound policies may be able to access resources with no or limited conditionality. The same is true for certain urgent and immediate needs covered by emergency financing instruments. IMF lending in action 1. First, a member country in need of financial support makes a request to the IMF. 2. Then, the country’s government and IMF staff discuss the economic and financial situation and financing needs. 3. Typically, before the IMF lends to a country, the country's government and the IMF agree on a program of economic policies. This initial understanding, known as a staff-level agreement (SLA) , is reached between IMF staff and the authorities of the member country. The SLA outlines the terms of a financial program or review but is not final until approved by the IMF Executive Board. In most cases, a country's commitments to undertake specific policy actions, known as policy conditionality, are integral to IMF lending. 4. Once the terms are agreed upon, the policy program underlying an arrangement is presented to the IMF’s Executive Board in a “Letter of Intent” and detailed in a “Memorandum of Understanding.” The IMF staff makes a recommendation to the Executive Board to endorse the country’s policy intentions and offer financing. This process can be expedited under the IMF’s Emergency Financing Mechanism. 5. After its Executive Board approves a loan, the IMF monitors how members implement the policy actions underpinning it. A country’s return to economic and financial health ensures that IMF funds are repaid so that they can be made available to other member . IMF lending instruments The IMF has several lending instruments to meet the different needs and specific circumstances of its members. IMF members have access to the General Resources Account on non-concessional terms (market-based interest rates), but the IMF also provides concessional financial support (currently at zero interest rates) through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust , which is better tailored to the diversity and needs of low-income . The recently established Resilience and Sustainability Trust offers longer-term financing to low-income and vulnerable middle-income  seeking to build resilience to external shocks at affordable interest rates. Reflecting different country circumstances and challenges, GRA-supported programs are expected to resolve the country’s balance of payments problems during the program period, while PRGT programs envisage a longer duration for addressing them. The RST provides financing to address longer-term challenges, including climate change and pandemic preparedness.

Does the IMF charge for its loans? All IMF members have access to financial support through the General Resources Account (GRA), which is subject to various charges. These charges are designed to cover the operational costs of the IMF and support its activities, including those related to providing policy advice and capacity development to member . Read more in this FAQ Basic charges: based on the market-determined Special Drawing Rights (SDR) interest rate – which has a minimum floor of 5 basis points – plus a margin established by the IMF Executive Board every two years (currently 60 basis points). Surcharges: high and prolonged borrowing of non-concessional resources is subject to surcharges. There are two types: Level-based surcharges: of 200 basis points are applied on the portion of GRA credit outstanding greater than 300 percent of quota ; Time-based surcharges: of 75 basis points are applied on the portion of credit exceeding the level-based threshold for more than 36 months (51 months in case of borrowings under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) ). Commitment fee: applied to the undisbursed portion of a loan. This fee is typically a small percentage of the loan amount. For most IMF lending instruments, the fee is levied at the beginning of each 12-month period on amounts that could be drawn in the period: 15 basis points for committed amounts up to 200 percent of quota ; 30 basis points on committed amounts above 200 percent and up to 600 percent of quota; and 60 basis points on amounts exceeding 600 percent of quota. In line with the 2024 Review of Charges and the Surcharge Policy , IMF staff is expected to provide granular projections of the cost of Fund borrowing and capacity to repay during discussions with country authorities on new GRA-financed, IMF-supported programs. Low-income  (LICs) may borrow under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) on concessional terms. The 2024 Review Of The Poverty Reduction And Growth Trust Facilities And Financing — Reform Proposals updated the facilities and financing terms available to LICs. As a result: Access policies have been adjusted to calibrate Fund financial support to the individual needs of LICs. Effective January 1, 2025, the access norm, which guides the level of access of Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and Stand-by Credit Facility (SCF) arrangements, is set at 145 percent of quota. Access limits remain at their current levels of 200 percent of quota annually, and 600 percent of quota in total, maintaining the higher levels that were decided as a temporary measure for 12 months by the Board in December 2023. The space between the norm and the limits provides significant flexibility to help  with higher needs. Safeguards were strengthened and streamlined, centered around the access norm, and reflecting the level of risks associated with higher PRGT credit exposure and elevated macroeconomic vulnerabilities in many LICs. Effective May 1, 2025, a new interest rate mechanism will apply to new PRGT lending. Outstanding credit under financing approved before that date, as well as new disbursements under existing arrangements, including potential augmentation of access, will remain subject to the current zero interest rate. The new mechanism will set interest rates at zero for the poorest PRGT-eligible members (around half of all LICs), and a modest, but still concessional, interest rates for the others. Commitment fees are refunded to the borrowing member, in proportion to the drawings made. If a country borrows the entire amount, the fee is fully refunded. Additional commitment fees and/or refunds may also apply under certain circumstances, for example whenever arrangements access amounts or periods are increased or decreased or cancelled. Service charge: a fixed charge on each amount drawn from the GRA (currently at 50 b asis points, except for the Short-term Liquidity Line (SLL) which has a reduced rate of 21 basis points). For detail on each type of non-concessional loan, see Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) , Extended Fund Facility (EFF) , Flexible Credit Line (FCL) , Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) , Short-term Liquidity Line (SLL) , and Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) .

    "content": "Glossary of Selected Financial Terms This glossary covers basic operational and financial terms used in th e IMF Financial Data Query Tool A Adjusted Rate of Remuneration Rate used to pay interest (remuneration) to members on their remunerated reserve tranche position with the IMF. Adjusted Rate of Charge Rate applied to charge members on their outstanding credit to the IMF. Agreed Amount The Agreed Amount represents the maximum amount available for drawing under an arrangement approved by the IMF ’s Executive Board. Average SDR Interest Rate Average of the weekly rates calculated at the end of each financial quarter for that quarter. B Basic Rate of Charge The basic rate of charge is equal to the SDR interest rate plus a margin. Basic Rate of Remuneration The basic (unadjusted) rate of remuneration is equal to the SDR interest rate. Bilateral Borrowing Agreements Bilateral Agreements are lending agreements between the IMF and a member country, or an agency of the member country, to supplement IMF lending resources. Buffer Stock Facility The Buffer Stock Financing Facility (BSF), established in 1969 and eliminated in 2000, provided financing to members with a balance of payments need to help finance their contributions to approved commodity price stabilization funds. Burden Sharing A policy in place since 1986 regarding the sharing, between members paying charges and members receiving rem uneration, of the financial consequences to the IMF of overdue obligations. An amount equal to overdue charges (excluding special charges) and an allocation to the Special Contingent Account are generated each quarter by an upward adjustment of the rate of charge and a downward adjustment of the rate of remuneration. C Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) The Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) was a special IMF financing facility established in 1963. Until its elimination in 2009, the CFF provided resources to members who encountered balance of payments difficulties, arising out of export shortfalls or excess costs of cereal imports that were temporary and resulted from  that were largely beyond the members’ control. Concessional Assistance The IMF initiated Concessional Assistance in 1976 through the establishment of the Trust Fund financed from the sale of part of the IMF gold holdings. In 1986, the IMF established the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) to provide concessional assistance to low -income  by recycling resources len t under the Trust Fund. In 1987, the SAF was enlarged to include resources from bilateral contributors and renamed Enlarged SAF (ESAF). In 1999, the ESAF Trust was renamed the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Trust (PRGF Trust). In 2006, the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) was added as another facility to provide assistance to low - income members facing sudden and exogenous shocks but do not have a PRGF arrangement. The PRGF Trust was renamed PRGF -ESF Trust and provided assistance through two facilities : the PRGF and the ESF. In 2008, the ESF was modified into two components to address worsening of global conditions: the Rapid Access Component (RAC) which provides emergency assistance in a single disbursement and a High Access Component (HAC) provided in multiple disbursements subject to reviews when more resources are needed. In 2010, the PRG Trust replaced the PRGF -ESF Trust and assistance is now provided through three facilities: the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF), an d the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Concessional loans are provided at a subsidized interest rate. Cumulative Quarterly Burden Sharing Adjustments Refundable resources collected on a quarterly basis under the Burden Sharing mechanism which is used by the IMF to compensate for income lost due to unpaid charges and to build up precautionary balances through contributions to the Special Contingent Accou nt (SCA). See Burden Sharing . CVA Account The Currency Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Account records the amount payable to the IMF or payable by the IMF depending on whether the member’ s currency has depreciated or appreciated vis -á-vis the SDR since the last revaluation of the balances in the IMF No. 1, IMF No. 2, and IMF Securities Accounts. D Deferred Charges Adjustments (Charges) Refundable resources collected on a quarterly basis from members with credit outstanding by adding an upward adjustment to the rate of charge. The purpose of these resources is to cover unpaid charges of members in arrears. Once members in arrears settle t heir charges, these resources are refunded to contributors. See Burden Sharing . Deferred Char ges Adjustments (Remuneration) Refundable resources collected on a quarterly basis from members receiving remuneration by adding a downward adjustment to the rate of remuneration. The purpose of these resources is to cover unpaid charges of members in arrears. Once members in arrears se ttle their charges, these resources are refunded to contributors. See Burden Sharing . Drawn Amount The Drawn Amount represents the cumulative amounts disbursed under an arrangement. E Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance (ENDA) Emergency financial assistance to  with urgent balance of payments financing needs in the wake of natural disasters. Emergency financial assistance was disbursed rapidly and without the need for program -based conditionality. ENDA is subsidized for low-income  and loans are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3 1/4 - 5 years after disbursement. In 2010, ENDA was superseded by t he Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for low -income members, and in 2012 —by the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) for al l member . Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) Emergency financial assistance to  with urgent balance of payments financing needs in the wake of armed conflicts. Emergency financial assistance was disbursed rapidly and without the need for program -based conditionality. EPCA is subsidized for l ow-income  and loans are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3 1/4 - 5 years after disbursement. In 2010, EPCA was superseded by t he Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for low -income members, and in 2012 —by the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) for all member . Enlarged Access Policy (EA) The Enlarged Access Policy (EA) was established as a temporary policy in 1980 as a successor to the Supplementary Financing Facility (SFF) and expired in 1992. The policy enabled the IMF to provide balance of payments assistance to members facing external payment imbalances that were large relative to their quota positions. The policy allowed the IMF to provide resources under stand -by or extended arrangements in amounts larger that would be available under other policies on the use of general resources and for a period longer than under the IMF’s regular tranche policies. Exogenous Shocks Facility - High Access Component (ESF -HAC) Concessional financing under the High Access Component of the ESF (ESF -HAC)(2008 -2010) to low-income member  facing balance of payments needs caused by sudden and exogenous shocks. Loans are repayable with a grace period of 5½ years and a final ma turity of 10 years. In 2010 the ESF -HAC was superseded by the Standby Credit Facility (SCF). Exogenous Shocks Facility - Rapid Access Component (ESF -RAC) Quick concessional assistance under the Rapid Access Component of the ESF (2008 -10) in the form of an outright disbursements to low -income member  facing balance of payments needs caused by exogenous shocks. Loans are repayable with a grace period of 5½ years and a final maturity of 10 years. In 2010, the ESF -RAC was superseded by the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Extended Credit Facility (ECF) The Extended Credit Facility (ECF), established in 2010 and formerly known as the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), provides concessional financial assistance in support of a three -year macroeconomic and structural adjustment program to eligibl e low -income members facing protracted balance of payment issues. The loans are repayable in 10 equal semiannual installments 5½ - 10 years after disbursement. Extended Fund Facility (EFF) The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) provides long -term assistance to support members’ structural reforms to address balance of payments difficulties of a long -term character. Drawings under extended arrangements are repayable in 12 semiannual installments 4½ - 10 years after disbursement. F FCL Principal Principal repayments (repurchase) of Flexible Credit Line (FCL) loans. First Credit Tranche Member  may make use of IMF credit to address balance of payment problems under Credit Tranche Policies or special policies called facilities. Under the Credit Tranche Policies, the IMF makes credit available in four tranches (segments), each equa l to 25 percent of a member’s quota. The First Credit Tranche represents use of IMF resources up to the limit of the first tranche on fairly liberal terms. Requests for use of IMF resources beyond the first credit tranche (in the upper credit tranches) req uire substantial justification for the expectation that the member’s balance of payments difficulties will be resolved within a reasonable period of time. Flexible Credit Line (FCL) The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) has been established to allow members with very strong track records to access IMF resources based on pre -set qualification criteria to deal with all types of balance of payments problems. The FCL could be used both on a prec autionary (crisis prevention) and nonprecautionary (crisis resolution) basis. Members may request either a one - year arrangement with no interim reviews, or a two -year arrangement with an interim review of qualification required after twelve months. Purchas es under FCL arrangements are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3¼ - 5 years after disbursement. G GRA Arrangements The General Resources Account (GRA) Arrangements comprise a variety of lending programs with different disbursement schedules and maturities depending on the balance of payment needs of the member. GRA Charges The General Resources Account (GRA) charges are payable by a member on its GRA outstanding credit. Charges accrue daily on the outstanding balance and are payable on a quarterly basis. GRA Credit Outstanding The General Resources Account (GRA) Credit Outstanding represents total GRA loans disbursed to members less repayments. GRA Purchases GRA Purchases are loans (purchases) disbursed to members under facilities of the IMF General Resources Account (GRA). GRA Repurchases GRA Repurchases are principal repayments (repurchase s) by members. GRA Special Charges GRA Special Charges are charges in addition to the basic rate of charge levied on financial obligations, including overdue principal (repurchases) and charges that are past due. H HIPC Assistance The Heavily Indebted Poor  (HIPC) Assistance represents resources provided eligible member  to help meet their debt service payments to the IMF. Disbursements are normally dependent on receipt of sufficient financing assurances from other creditors. I IMF No. 1 Account The IMF No. 1 Account represents part of the IMF currency holdings held in member ’s designated depository agency which is used for the IMF ’s operations, including, inter alia, quota subscription payments, purchases, and repurchases. The No. 1 Account is a cash account. Members are required to maintain a minimum in No. 1 Account equal to 1/4 of 1 percent of the member ’s quota at all times. IMF No. 2 Account The IMF No. 2 Account represents part of the IMF currency holdings held in member ’s designated depository agency and it is used for the payment of administrative expenses incurred by the IMF in the member ’s currency, e.g., expenses of the IMF representative offices. IMF Securities Account The IMF Securities Account represents part of the IMF c urrency holdings held in member’ s designated depository agency which contain member’s nonnegotiable, non -interest bearing notes encashable on demand. IMF’s Holdings of Currencies IMF’s Holdings of Currencies represent members ’ paid -in quota subscription in local currencies that are held in designated depository agencies (e.g. , central banks). Currency holdings are held in three accounts: IMF No. 1, IMF No. 2, and IMF Securities Accounts. N Net SDR Charges The SDR Department pays interest on holdings of SDRs and levies charges on the cumulative allocation of SDRs to participants (all IMF members are participants) at the same interest rate. Participants whose holdings are below their cumulative holdings incur net charges, i.e., the charges net of the interest. Both SDR interest and charges accrue daily and are settled quarterly. New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) The New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) is a standing set of credit arrangements under which the participants (member  and institutions) commit to provide supplementary resources to the IMF when these are needed to forestall or cope with an impairmen t of the international monetary system. The NAB is the facility of first and principal recourse in circumstances in which the IMF needs to supplement its quota resources. Notes Purchase Agreements (NPA) To supplement its capacity to provide finance assistance to its members, the IMF issues promissory notes to the official sector under the Notes Purchase Agreements (NPA). The NPA includes a limit on the total amount that can be purchased during the term of the NPA. Notes are issued at the time of a loan disb ursement to a borrowing member. O Oil Facility Two Oil Facilities were established in response to the oil price shock in the 1970s. The first Oil Facility was created in June 1974 and lapsed in December 1974. The second Oil Facility was created in April 1975 to provide additional financing, and lapsed in March 1976. Both facilities aimed at providing supplementary financing to member  facing balance of payments problems and were adversely affected by higher oil prices. Loans under the Oil facilities were repayable in 16 quarterly installments 3 –7 years after disbursement. Original Arrangement Date Original Arrangement Date is the date when the IMF ’s Executive Board approves the arrangement. Original Disbursement Date Original Disbursement Date is the date when the funds were disbursed to the member. Overdue Interest Overdue Interest on PRGT loans. P Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) Established to meet actual or potential balance of payments needs of members with sound economic fundamentals and institutional policy frameworks but with some remaining vulnerabilities that preclude them from using the FCL. Access under a PLL arrangement varies depending on the duration of the arrangement, ranging from six months to two years, and member -specific needs. Under a six -month arrangement, access could be up to 250 percent of a member’s quota, with a possibility to be augmented to a maximum of 5 00 percent in exceptional circumstances. For one to two year arrangements, the maximum access is equal to 500 percent of a member’s quota for the first year and up to 1000 percent of quota for the second year. Purchases under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line a re repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3 1/4 - 5 years after disbursement. Prescribed Holder A nonparticipant in the SDR Department that has been prescribed by the IMF as a holder of SDRs, including nonmembers, member  that are not SDR Department participants, institutions that perform the functions of a central bank for more than one mem ber, and other official entities. PRG Trust The Poverty Reduction Growth Trust (PRGT) had been originally established as the ESAF Trust in 1987 to provide concessional assistance to low -income members and was subsequently enlarged and renamed. PRGT was previously known as ESAF (1987 -1999), PRGF (199 9-2006), PRGF -ESF (2006 -2010) Trusts. The PRGT provides financial assistance under three facilities: the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) to address protracted balance of payments (BOP) needs, the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) to address short -term and precautionary BOP needs, and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) to provide rapid low access with limited conditionality to meet urgent BOP needs. PRGT Arrangements The Poverty Reduction Growth Trust (PRGT) Arrangements represent lending programs providing concessional financing support to low -income . PRGT Credit Outstanding The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) Credit Outstanding represents total PRGT resources disbursed, including outstanding Trust Fund and Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) loans, less repayments. PRGT Disbursements PRGT Disbursements are concessional loans disbursed to members under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). PRGT Interest The PRGT Interest is payable quarter ly by a member on its outstanding concessional loans . A tiered interest rate structure differentiates financing terms across groups of  (Tier 1, Tier 2B, and Tier 2A) with lower income members benefiting from more concessional terms. PRGT Repayments Principal repayments of concessional loans disbursed by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). Q Quota Each member of the IMF is assigned a quota, denominated in SDRs, that is based broadly on the country ’s economic position relative to other members. The size of a country ’s quota takes into account its GDP, current account transactions, and official reserves. Quotas determine members ’ capital subscriptions to the IMF, voting power, and the amount of financial assistance available to them from the IMF. Quotas are normally reviewed, and possibly adjusted, every five years. R Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) Established in 2010 to provide low access, rapid, and concessional financial assistance to low - income member  facing an urgent balance of payments need. It is provided as an outright disbursement without explicit program -based conditionality or reviews. The RCF streamlines the IMF’s emergency assistance for low -income members and provides flexible support in a wide variety of circumstances, including shocks, natural disasters, and emergencies resulting from fragility. RCF loans have a grace period of 5½ years and a maturity of 10 years. Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) Established in 2012 to provide rapid and low -access financial assistance to all member  facing an urgent balance of payments need in the aftermath of commodity price shocks, natural disasters, post -conflict situations and emergencies resulting from fragility without th e need for a full -fledged program. The RFI has replaced the previous emergency assistance policy that covered Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance (ENDA) and Emergency Post -Conflict Assistance (EPCA). Financial assistance is provided in the form of outright purchases and outstanding principal (purchases) are repaid within 3¼ to 5 years. Rate of Charge Rate applied to charge members on their outstanding credit to the IMF. Rate of Charge Adjustment for Deferred Charges A refundable adjustment to the rate of charge that is made under the burden sharing mechanism. Rate of Charge Adjustment for SCA -1 A refundable adjustment to the rate of remuneration that was made under the burden sharing mechanism and allocated to the first Special Contingent Account (SCA -1). Rate of Remuneration Rate used to pay interest (remuneration) to members on their remunerated reserve tranche position with the IMF. Rate of Remuneration Adjustment for Deferred Charges A refundable adjustment to the rate of remuneration that is made under the burden sharing mechanism. Rate of Re muneration Adjustment for SCA -1 A refundable adjustment to the rate of remuneration that was made under the burden sharing mechanism and allocated to the first Special Contingent Account (SCA -1). RCF Principal Principal repayments (repurchase) of Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) loans. Reserve Tranche Position (RTP) The Reserve Tranche Positi on (RTP) is equal to the member’ s quota less the IMF ’s holdings of the member ’s currency in the GRA . It is part of the member’ s external reserves. RFI Principal Principal repayments (repurchase) of Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) loans. Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) The RST was established in 2022 to help low -income and vulnerable middle -income  build resilience to external shocks and ensure sustainable growth, contributing to their longer - term balance of payments stability. It complements the IMF’s existing lending toolkit by providing longer -term, affordable financing to address longer -term challenges, including climate change and pandemic preparedness. RSF Arrangement The Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) Arrangement represents the lending program under which eligible members can access financing under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST). A concurrent IMF -supported program with upper credit tranche quality policies (UCT program) is required. RST Credit Outstanding The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) Credit Outstanding represents total RST loans disbursed to members less repayments. RST Disbursements RST disbursements are long -term loans disbursed to members under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST). RST loans under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) have a 20-year maturity and a 10½ -year grace period during which no principal is repaid. RST Interest Interest under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) is payable quarterly by a member on its outstanding RSF loans. A tiered interest structure differentiates financing terms across country groups, with low -income members benefiting from more concessional terms . RST Repayments Principal repayments of long -term loans disbursed by the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST). S SAF Interest The SAF Interest is payable semiannually by a member on outstanding credit under the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF), excluding additional interest levied on overdue SAF interest. SCA-1 Adjustmen ts (Charges) Refundable resources collected on a quarterly basis from members with credit outstanding by adding an upward adjustment to the rate of charge and allocated to the first Special Contingent Account (SCA -1). These resources build up precautionary balances to protect the IMF against potential losses from members’ ultimate failure to settle overdue repurchase obligations. SCA -1 adjustments are refunded to the contributors when there are no outstanding overdue obligations, or at such earlier time as the IMF may d ecide. See Burden Sharing . SCA-1 Adjustments (Remuneration) Refundable resources collected on a quarterly basis from members receiving remuneration by adding a downward adjustment to the rate of remuneration and allocated to the first Special Contingent Account (SCA -1). These resources build up precautionary balanc es to protect the IMF against potential losses from members’ ultimate failure to settle overdue repurchase obligations. SCA-1 adjustments are refunded to the contributors when there are no outstanding overdue obligations, or at such earlier time as the IMF may decide. See Burden Sharing. Schedule Date The Schedule Date is the actual date when a member is scheduled to repay its obligation. SDR Allocations SDR Allocations are a distribution of SDRs to members by decision of the IMF. A general allocation requires a finding by the IMF that there is a global need for additional liquidity . Allocations of SDRs are made to participa nts in the SDR department (currently, all IMF members are participants) in proportion to their quotas in the IMF. SDR Assessments SDR Assessments are levied on participants in the SDR Department annually to reimburse the IMF for expenses incurred in operating the SDR Department. SDR Holdings The Special Drawing Right (SDR) is an interest -bearing reserve asset created by the IMF to supplement members’ reserve assets. It is a purely official asset and can only be held and used by members in the SDR department, the IMF, and certain designated official entities. SDR holdings can be exchanged with other members for freely usable currency. SDR Interest Rate The SDR Interest Rate is a weighted average of interest rates on short -term financial instruments in the markets of the currencies included in t he SDR valuation basket. The SDR Interest Rate is determined on a weekly basis and is subject to a 0.050 percent floor . It also serves as basis for calculating interest paid and charged to members. SFF Charges SFF Charges are charges under the Supplementary Financing Facility. Short -Term Liquidity Line (SLL) The Short -term Liquidity Line (SLL) has been established to allow members with very strong track records to access IMF resources based on pre -set qualification criteria to deal with potential moderate short -term balance of payment needs arising due to capi tal account pressures. Individual SLL arrangements will be approved for a period of 12 months with access capped at the normal annual access limit, and successor arrangements could be approved for as long as the member continues to qualify and have the spe cial BoP need. Purchases under SLL arrangements are expected to be repurchased in 1 bullet installment 12 months after the disbursement. As the SLL is a swap -like facility with revolving access, it enables repeated (partial or full) purchases and repurchas es within and across SLL arrangements. Repurchases would reconstitute the member ’s right to purchase up to the maximum access approved. Stand -By Arrangement (SBA) The Stand -By Arrangement (SBA) is the most common type of credit arrangement designed to provide short -term financial assistance. Purchases under Stand -By Arrangements are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3 1/4 - 5 years aft er disbursement. Standby Credit Facility (SCF) Established in 2010 to provide concessional financial assistance to low -income  that are experiencing short -term but not protracted balance of payments needs. SCF arrangements range from one to two years. Loans are repayable in 9 equal semiannual i nstallments 4 –8 years after disbursement. Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) The Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) was created in 1986 to provide concessional financing to assist low -income  in addressing balance of payments financing needs arising from structural weaknesses. The SAF was financed by reflows of Trust Fun d repayments, and its loans were extended on the same terms with a 5½ years grace period and repayable in 10 years and at the interest rate of ½ percent per annum. Supplemental Financing Facility (SFF) During 1979 -1981, the SFF allowed  with a Stand -By or Extended Arrangements to obtain supplementary and parallel credits financed by the borrowed resources . Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) During 1997 -2009, the SRF provided financial assistance to member  experiencing exceptional balance of payments difficulties due to a large short -term financing need related to a sudden and disruptive loss of market confidence. Financial resources under this facility were provided under an associated stand -by or extended arrangement and generally available in two or more drawings which were expected to be repaid by the member within 1 to 1 ½ years of the date of each purchase, subject to extension of up to one year. Systemic Transformation Facility (STF) During 1993 -1995, the STF provided temporary assistance to  in transition from centrally planned to market economies facing balance of payments difficulties. Assistance was provided in small amounts with low conditionality. T TF Special Charges TF Special Charges are charges levied on overdue Trust Fund loans. Transaction Value Date The Transaction Value Date is the date of the financial transaction. Trust Fund The Trust Fund (1976 -1981) was set up to provide special balance of payments assistance on concessional terms to developing members. These loans offered a 5½ years grace period and were repayable in 10 years, at an interest rate of ½ percent per annum. Trust Fund Interest The Trust Fund Interest is payable semiannually by a member on outstanding TF credit . U Undrawn Amount Amount undrawn represents an amount that currently remains to be drawn under the arrangement. For SLL arrangements, it is equal to the Agreed Amount less the balance of current credit outstanding under the current or any previous SLL arrangements. For all other arrangements, it is equal to the Agreed Amount less Drawn Amount ."

On October 24, 2014, the Executive Board of the IMF amended the rule for setting the SDR interest rate to be the higher of (i) the above combined market interest rate or (ii) 0.050 percent, the result of which is rounded to three (instead of two) decimal places. (See: https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/sdr_ir.aspx ) Rate of Charge, adjusted The basic rate of charge on GRA loans is equal to the SDR interest rate plus 60 basis points to cover the IMF's cost of financing, additions to reserves, and administrative expenses; and further adjusted by a small margin to compensate for income forgone because of charges in arrears.

Repayments of borrowings one-year forward Repayment obligations on Fund borrowing and note placements in the coming one- year period, including drawings and notes reaching final maturity in the next 12 months plus any encashment requests for early repayment to be met over that same period. Prudential balance Amount set aside to safeguard the liquidity of members’ claims and take account of the potential erosion of the IMF’s resource base. The prudential balance is set at 20 percent of the quotas of members participating in the financing of IMF transactions (Financial Transactions Plan) and any amounts made available under active bilateral borrowing and note purchase agreements with non- NAB participants, which were terminated on April 1, 2013. The prudential balance currently does not cover the encashment needs of NAB participants’ outstanding claims under bilateral borrowing agreements that are folded into the NAB. Nor does it extend to the claims of participants in the expanded NAB; as such resources are to be provided by setting aside a portion of the total credit arrangements under the NAB. The prudential ratio of 20 percent as decided by the IMF’s Executive Board reflects historical experience and judgments on the indicative level of uncommitted usable resources that the IMF would normally not use to make financial commitments. The prudential balance does not represent a rigid minimum and IMF resources could, on a strictly temporary basis, fall below this level. Key IMF Financial Statistics 6 Current Financial Arrangements (GRA, PRGT, RST) Term Definition Arrangements IMF credit is made available under a variety of borrowing arrangements with different disbursement schedules and maturities depending on the balance of payment needs of the member. GRA Stand -By Arrangements The most common type of credit arrangement designed to provide short -term financial assistance. Purchases under Stand -By Arrangements are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3¼ - 5 years after disbursement. Extended Arrangements Extended Arrangements provide credit for a longer period since these arrangements usually require fundamental reforms which may need more time to put in place and take effect. Drawings under extended arrangements are repayable in 12 semiannual installments 4½ - 10 years after disbursement. Flexible Credit Line The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) has been established to allow members with very strong track records to access IMF resources based on pre -set qualification criteria to deal with all types of balance of payments problems. The FCL could be used both on a precautionary (crisis prevention) and non-precautionary (crisis resolution) basis. Purchases under FCL arrangements are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3¼ - 5 years after disbursement. Precautionary and Liquidity Line The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), which replaces the Precautionary Credit Line (PCL), has been established to meet actual or potential balance of payments needs of members with sound economic fundamentals and institutional policy frameworks but with some remaining vulnerabilities that preclude them from using the FCL. Purchases under PLL arrangements are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3¼ - 5 years after disbursement. PRG Trust ECF Arrangements Concessional arrangements providing credit in support of a three -year macroeconomic and structural adjustment program to eligible low -income members facing protracted balance of payment issues (formerly known as PRGF). The loans are repayable in 10 equal semiannual installments 5½ - 10 years after disbursement. SCF Arrangements Concessional arrangements ranging from one to two years to provide financial assistance to low -income  that are experiencing short -term but not protracted balance of payments needs. The loans are repayable in 9 equal semiannual installments 4 - 8 years after disbursement. Interest on all PRGT loans (including outright drawings under the RCF) has been waived through end- December 2018. RS Trust Resilience and Sustainability The RSF is designed to help members tackle longer -term challenges like climate change and Facility Arrangement pandemic preparedness. The arrangement should be accompanied by an upper credit tranche program under the GRA and/or PRGT. Loans under the RSF are repayable in 20 equal semiannual installments 101/2 – 20 years after disbursement.

    "content": "19II General Department Introduction The IMF’s resources are held in the General Department, which consists of three separate accounts: the General Resources Account (GRA), theSpecial Disbursement Account (SDA), and the Investment Account. General Resources Account The GRA is the principal account of the IMF and handles by far the larg- est  of transactions between the IMF and its membership. The GRAcan best be described as a pool of currencies and reserve assets built up frommembers’ fully paid capital subscriptions in the form of quotas. 1 Quotas are the basic building blocks of the IMF. They broadly reflect each member’srelative economic size, taking into account the quotas of similar .Quotas determine the maximum amount of financial resources that a mem-ber is obligated to provide to the IMF, voting power in IMF decision making, and a member’s  of SDR allocations. The financial assistance a member may obtain from the IMF is also generally based on its quota. The financial structure of the IMF rests on the principle that quota sub- scriptions are the basic source of financing for the GRA. A quarter of amember’s quota subscription is normally paid in reserve assets, with theremainder paid in the member’s own currency. 2 Currencies held by the IMF are of two types, usable and unusable. A currency is usable if the issuingmember’s external payments position is strong enough for it to be calledupon to finance IMF credit to other members. Other currencies, that is, the 1Reserve assets are those that are readily available and accepted for international pay- ments, such as the four currencies currently recognized as “freely usable” by the IMF: the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and pound sterling. A freely usable currency is one that the IMF determines is widely used to make payments for international transactions and istraded in the principal exchange markets. 2Prior to the Second Amendment of the IMF Articles on April 1, 1978, the reserve asset portion was paid in gold, and after that, in SDRs or “usable” currencies of other membersas determined by the IMF. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 20currencies of borrowers or financially weak members, are considered unus- able. Thus, a portion of the GRA’s pool of resources consists of currencies that cannot be used, leaving the IMF’s effective lending capacity at about half of total quotas.3 The IMF may also supplement its quota resources by borrowing and through additions to its precautionary balances. These balances comprisereserves in the GRA as well as resources that have been set aside in the first Special Contingent Account (SCA-1) to protect against the risk of overdue payments. These resources are not segregated from other resources of theGRA and can therefore finance the extension of credit. With its usable resources, the IMF provides financing to its member coun- tries. Members “borrow” from the GRA under the IMF’s “credit tranche” policies or under special policies or facilities. 4 The credit tranches provide financing for balance of payments need, arising from almost any cause,whereas credits under other facilities deal with needs arising from specifiedcauses. Financial assistance is typically made available in installments thatare linked to the borrowing country’s observance of specific economic andfinancial policy conditions that must be met before the next installment isreleased. These conditions are agreed with the member under agreements called “arrangements . ” Members using IMF resources pay a market-based rate of interest on their outstanding use of credit from the IMF. A member’s financial position in the IMF is measured by the GRA’s hold- ings of its currency relative to quota. Members draw on the IMF’s pool ofmembers’ currencies and SDRs through a purchase-repurchase mechanism (Box II.1). A member obtaining resources from the IMF “purchases” either SDRs or the currency of another member in exchange for an equivalentamount (in SDR terms) of its own currency, and later reverses the transaction 3A member with usable currency pays in a usable currency whereas other members pay only the reserve asset portion in usable currency. Any member may pay the reserve asset portion in SDRs. Currencies are held by the IMF in depository accounts at members’ cen-tral banks. Payment of the nonreserve asset portion of quota subscriptions is normally in the form of promissory notes (nonnegotiable, non-interest-bearing securities) that are con- verted into currency on demand. 4GRA credit is normally governed by the IMF’s general lending policies (also known as “credit tranche” policies), as opposed to the special policies that apply to other types ofcredit. Both sets of policies are discussed in the section “Credit Outstanding.” IMF credit has traditionally been provided in “tranches” (segments), equivalent to 25 percent of quota, as explained in the section “Credit Tranche Policies.” “Borrowing” is undertaken through the purchase-repurchase mechanism, which is discussed in Box II.1. II General Department 21BOX II.1. T HE IMF’ S MAJOR FINANCING MECHANISM The IMF’s lending is financed from the capital d by member coun- tries. Each country is assigned a quota that determines its maximum financialcommitment to the IMF. A portion of the quota is provided in the form ofreserve assets (foreign currencies acceptable to the IMF or SDRs) and theremainder in its own currency. The IMF extends financing by providing reserveassets to the borrower from the reserve asset subscriptions of members or bycalling on  that are considered financially strong to exchange theircurrency subscriptions for reserve assets. The loan is disbursed or drawn by the borrower “purchasing” the reserve assets from the IMF with its own currency. 1 Repayment of the loan is achieved by the borrower “repurchasing” its currency from the IMF with reserve assets.The IMF levies a basic rate of interest (charges) on loans based on the SDRinterest rate and imposes surcharges depending on the amount and maturity ofthe loan and the level of credit outstanding. A country that provides reserve assets to the IMF as part of its quota sub- scription or through the use of its currency receives a liquid claim on the IMF(a reserve, or reserve tranche, position) which can be encashed on demand toobtain reserve assets to meet a balance of payments financing need. These claims earn interest (remuneration) based on the SDR interest rate and are considered by members as part of their international reserve assets. AsIMF loans are repaid (repurchased) by the borrower with reserve assets, thesefunds are transferred to the creditor  in exchange for their currenciesand the creditor claim on the IMF is extinguished. The purchase-repurchase approach to IMF lending affects the composition of the IMF’s resources but not the overall size. An increase in loans outstand- ing will reduce the IMF’s holdings of reserve assets and the currencies of mem- bers that are financially strong and increase the IMF’s holdings of thecurrencies of  that are borrowing from the IMF. The amount of theIMF’s holdings of reserve assets and the currencies of financially strong coun- tries determines the IMF’s lending capacity (liquidity). While the purchase-repurchase mechanism is not technically or legally a “ l o a n , ” i t i s t h e f u n c t i o n a l e q u i v a l e n t o f a l o a n . S i mi l a r l y , I M F l e n d i n g“arrangements” provide for drawings in installments upon the fulfillment ofcertain policy conditions. Thus, they are similar to conditional lines of credit.For ease of reference, these more commonly understood terms are often usedin this pamphlet rather than the unique internal IMF terminology. 1In making a purchase, the member provides domestic currency to the IMF addi- tional to currency previously paid to the IMF for the member’s quota subscription. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 22by a “repurchase” of its currency held by the IMF with SDRs or the currency of another member.5 Members receive a liquid claim on the IMF (called a reserve, or reserve tranche, position) for the reserve assets they provide to the IMF. This claimearns a market-related rate of interest (called remuneration) and can be encashed on demand to obtain reserve assets from the IMF. Consequently, a member’s provision of reserve assets to the IMF changes the composition of the member’s reserve assets —from, for example, U.S. dollars to claims on the IMF —rather than the overall size of its international reserve assets. As the borrower repays the IMF loan (repurchases its currency with reserve assets), these funds are transferred to the creditor  in exchange for their currencies, and the creditor’s claim on the IMF is extinguished. A member’s purchase of currency reduces the IMF’s holdings of the cur- rency purchased, enlarges the reserve tranche position of the country whosecurrency is purchased, and increases the IMF’s holdings of the purchasing member’s currency. Charges (interest) are not levied on purchases within the reserve tranche, as these resources are the member’s own reserves. Inter- est is charged on the use of IMF credit, which is obtained through purchases outside of the reserve tranche. A member can choose whether or not to useits reserve tranche before utilizing IMF credit. Alternative financial posi- tions of members in the IMF’s pool of resources in the GRA are illustrated in Figure II.1. The currency purchased from the IMF must be that of a member with a strong external position, whose d currency is considered usable forIMF transactions. If the currency purchased is not freely usable, the member whose currency is purchased is obliged to exchange purchased amounts of its currency for freely usable currencies. If the purchased currency is freely usable, the borrower can undertake transactions in the private exchange markets or with the issuer of the freely usable currency to acquire a differentcurrency. A member whose currency is being used is obligated, if necessary, to provide an amount of reserve assets of up to 100 percent of its quota. The amount of reserve assets provided to the IMF has in practice fallen well short of this maximum. In planning and executing members’ transactions, members’ currencies are used in the financing of IMF credit according to their relative quota s. In turn, members’ currencies are used in effect- 5This financing mechanism has its roots in the credit facilities that existed between cen- tral banks before the IMF was established.

FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 24ing receipts to the IMF in a manner that adjusts reserve tranche positions toward a uniform proportion of their quotas.6 The purchase-repurchase mechanism explains why, from an accounting perspective, the IMF’s total resources do not vary as a result of the IMF’s financial assistance —only the composition of its assets change. Moreover, the value of members’ currencies held in the GRA’s pool of resources is maintained in SDR terms over time through periodic additions to the amounts of currencies that are depreciating against the SDR and reductionsfrom those that are appreciating against the SDR. This maintenance of value provision is an obligation of members under the Articles. 7 Special Disbursement Account The Special Disbursement Account (SDA) is the vehicle for receiving and investing profits from the sale of the IMF’s gold (i.e., the net proceeds in excess of the book value of SDR 35 a fine ounce), and for making transfersto other accounts for special purposes authorized in the Articles, in particu- lar for financial assistance to low-income members of the IMF. Investment Account The IMF is authorized to establish an Investment Account in the General Department; to date, however, no decision has been taken to this effect. Investments of amounts up to the level of accumulated reserves may bemade only in income-generating marketable obligations of international financial organizations or of the member whose currency is used for the investment. 8 The income may be reinvested or used to meet the expenses of conducting the business of the IMF, including both operational and adminis- trative expenses. 6For an analysis of the key elements underlying the GRA’s costs and revenues and past proposals for simplification or modification, see “Financing the Fund’s Operations— Review of Issues,” March 2000, on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/ ffo/2001/fin.htm). 7Article V , Section 11 (a). 8The resources in the GRA are managed in such a way as to lower the IMF’s costs or to increase the IMF’s revenue. In order to be more profitable than GRA resources, resources in an Investment Account would need to be invested at a rate that exceeds the SDR inter-est rate after taking into account any exchange risk. II General Department 25The Balance Sheet The relationships among the sources and uses of resources in the General Department, and their relative magnitudes, are summarized in its balancesheet (Table II.1). On the asset side, the first major item is credit outstanding at the end of FY2001 of SDR 42.2 billion, which is the value of financing extended by the IMF to its members. Financing to debtor members is largely funded by theuse of the currencies of creditor members and is reflected in the resultingreserve tranche positions of creditor members (see Box II.1). Members withoutstanding credit pay a market-related rate of interest on these loans whichfully covers the payment of interest to the creditors providing the resources to the IMF, as further explained below. The vast bulk of other assets held by the IMF in the GRA was usable and other currencies, equal to SDR 165.7 bil-lion. Gold, valued at SDR 5.9 billion, represented a relatively small  oftotal assets. 9 The IMF receives no interest on its gold or currency holdings that do not result from the extension of IMF credit. The only interest-bearingasset held by the IMF other than its outstanding credit is its holdings of SDRs, which were SDR 2.4 billion. With the addition of some minor receiv- ables and other assets, total assets of the GRA at end-April 2001 amountedto SDR 217.5 billion. On the resources and liabilities side, total quota resources were SDR 212.4 billion on April 30, 2001. As noted above, some of these subscriptionresources were usable and some were not. Usable currencies amounted to SDR 109.7 billion and unusable currencies SDR 56.0 billion. In addition, there were SDR 46.7 billion in reserve tranche positions of members. Thereserve tranche positions of IMF members result from initial quota paymentsand the increase due to the extension of IMF credit to other members. Thesereserve positions earn a market-related rate of return, as explained below.Precautionary balances, which include reserves and the balance in the Special Contingent Account (SCA), amounted to an additional SDR 4.5 billion. Add- ing a small amount of interest (remuneration) payable and some other minorliabilities gives a total of SDR 217.5 billion of GRA resources and liabilities. 9The IMF’s holdings of gold are valued at historical cost.

At end-April 2001, the IMF did not have any outstanding borrowing, but if it had, the amount of borrowing outstanding would have been shown on theliabilities side, with additional offsetting credit extended by the IMF to itsmembers on the asset side. A comparison of the relative size of theseresources and liabilities demonstrates that the IMF is overwhelmingly aquota-based institution. II General Department 27The rest of the General Department consists solely of the relatively small amount of assets and liabilities of the SDA, SDR 2.8 billion at end-April 2001. These represent the accumulated resources of the account, which reflect the profits and investment returns realized on past gold sales on theresources side, and the investment of these resources on the asset side. Theincome from these investments is transferred to the PRGF and PRGF-HIPCTrusts to provide concessional financial assistance to low-income members.There was also a small amount (SDR 0.4 billion) of loans still outstanding from the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) at end-April 2001. 10 T hese loans were financed with SDA resources. The remainder of this chapter expands upon the above discussion. It first discusses each item on the asset side of the GRA —namely, credit outstand- ing, which includes a description of the various terms and conditions of IMFlending, followed by relatively short sections on currency, SDR, and gold holdings. It then describes each item on the resources and liabilities side of the GRA —namely, quotas, including reserve tranche positions, and precau- tionary balances. Next, the chapter explains how the supply of and demandfor GRA resources is managed through the quarterly financial transactionsplan, and how the IMF monitors its overall level of liquidity in the GRA.Finally, it shows how IMF transactions are reflected in the accounts and bal- ance sheets of member . The management and investment strategy for the resources in the SDA is covered in Chapter IV . The Asset Side Credit Outstanding Credit outstanding, as the caption suggests, represents loans already pro- vided to members under the various IMF facilities. This section firstdescribes the general terms and conditions of IMF lending, followed by a discussion of the IMF’s financial policies and lending facilities. 10The SAF is discussed in Chapter IV . FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 28General Terms and Conditions Balance of Payments Need Members using IMF resources must have a balance of payments need. A borrowing member cannot use IMF resources in the absence of a represen- tation of balance of payments need, and the extent of their use cannot exceed that need. Borrowing usually takes place under an IMF arrange-ment, which is similar to a conditional line of credit and is associated with the implementation of an economic reform program in a member country. The most common type of arrangement is a Stand-By Arrangement in thecredit tranches or an arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). 11 Such arrangements can be approved on the basis of a prospective balance of payments need, although the existence of a balance of paymentsneed does not, in itself, entitle a member to draw on the IMF. The concept of balance of payments need has evolved over time. The con- cept includes three distinct elements: the balance of payments position ofthe member, its foreign reserve position, and developments in its reserve position. 12 These three elements are regarded as separate, and a representa- tion of need can be based on any one of them. An operational frameworkhas been developed over the years to serve as the basis for judgments on the magnitude of balance of payments deficits and the adequacy of foreign reserves. In the implementation of this framework, the circumstances ofmembers are taken into account. Once an arrangement has been approved by the IMF, a member’s repre- sentation of balance of payments need to make a purchase is not subject tochallenge, under a long-standing policy intended to assure the member of the availability of IMF resources committed to it, subject only to its meeting conditions specified in the arrangement. However, the IMF may take reme-dial action after a purchase under an arrangement or a reserve tranche pur- chase if it finds that the conditions for the purchase were not met, including that of balance of payments need. Other conditions may also be required. The IMF’s policies under particu- lar facilities may also stipulate requirements concerning the origins and nature of the underlying balance of payments disequilibrium. For instance, 11See discussion below under “Financial Policies and Facilities.” 12Article V, Section 3 (b)(ii). II General Department 29the use of the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) is restricted to tempo- rary balance of payments deficits arising from overall export shortfalls orincreased costs of specified cereal imports. Access Policy The policy of the IMF is to encourage members to approach it for assis- tance at an early stage of their balance of payments difficulties. Members experiencing balance of payments problems can approach the IMF, but are under no obligation to do so at any time. Over the years, it has come to be recognized that the efficacy of the mixture of adjustment polices and financ- ing depends largely on the early adoption of corrective policy measures. Early resort to an adjustment program supported by IMF resources can help to avoid more drastic policy actions that may otherwise be required, thereby limiting the impact of the adjustment on other members. Quantitative limits on access are used to ensure equal treatment of mem- bers. Access limits are set in terms of quota, the basic measure of members’ financial rights and obligations in the IMF. For the credit tranches and the EFF, which account for the lion’s  of IMF lending, the current limits take the form of an annual limit of 100 percent of quota on purchases over any 12-month period and a cumulative limit of 300 percent of quota on the level of IMF credit outstanding. Average annual access under these lending arrangements in recent years has been 40–50 percent of quota (Figure II.2). Other IMF facilities are subject to separate access limits or, in some cases, no explicit limits (Box II.2). In exceptional circumstances, these limits can be waived, as they were for members most immediately affected by the severe financial crises of the late 1990s. The level of access to GRA resources under Stand-By Arrangements and the EFF —that is, the amount that can be borrowed —is based on criteria that are applied uniformly to all members. These criteria seek to balance the needs of members against the overarching responsibility of the institution to safeguard and ensure the temporary use of its resources. The criteria are: • actual or potential need for resources from the IMF, taking into account other sources of financing and the desirability of maintaining a reason- able level of reserves; • ability to service indebtedness to the IMF, thereby protecting the revolving character of IMF resources; • amount of the outstanding use of IMF credit and record in using IMF resoures in the past. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 30Phasing of Purchases An important feature of IMF lending is the phasing of disbursements. All arrangements above 25 percent of quota in the credit tranches —the upper credit tranches —and under the EFF are subject to conditionality and the phasing of purchases (see Chapter V). Purchases in the first credit tranche (up to 25 percent of quota) are not phased, but do incorporate some policy conditionality. Phasing refers to the practice of making IMF resources available in install- ments over the period of an arrangement, typically quarterly, subject to the observance of performance criteria, the completion of a program review, or both.13 This is intended to ensure that IMF financing goes hand in hand with 13An “arrangement” is an assurance by the IMF that it stands ready to provide foreign exchange or SDRs under certain conditions during a specified period of time. The arrange- ment is in support of a detailed economic “adjustment program” of the member. See theGlossary for definitions of these terms.FIGURE II.2.

T HE FRAMEWORK FOR ACCESS TO IMF R ESOURCES Quota-based access limits •T h e credit tranches (mainly accessed through Stand-By Arrangements) and the Extended Fund Facility (EF F) ar e su b j e ct t o t he sa me a cc es s li mits . These consist of an annual limit of 100 percent of quota and a cumulative limit of 300 percent of quota. The annual limit applies to gross purchases in any 12- month period. The cumulative limit applies to credit outstanding, less sched-uled repurchases, plus scheduled purchases, over the period of commitment ofresources. These limits may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Aver-age annual access has been fairly stable at around half of the annual limit inrecent years (see Figure II.2). • Access under the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) is subject to its own limits. These limits are cumulative, and include limits of 45 percent ofquota each for access under the export shortfalls and excess cereal imports ele-ments, and a combined limit of 55 percent of quota. These limits cannot beexceeded. • T h e a mo u n t o f emergency assistance f o r n a t u r a l d i s a s t e r s a n d f o r p o s t - conflict cases is limited, in any one instance, to 25 percent of quota. Largeramounts can be made available on an exceptional basis in post-conflict cases.Emergency assistance was until recently subject to the access limits under thecredit tranches but was converted into a facility and excluded from theseaccess limits, pending further review. Access to other facilities •T h e Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) is not subject to explicit access limits. SRF resources are provided under Stand-By or Extended Arrange-ments in addition to credit tranche or EFF resources, which are subject toannual and cumulative limits. The IMF uses the same criteria for access to itsresources under all policies and facilities (see section on “General Terms andConditions”) but in the case of the SRF also takes into account the liquidityposition of the IMF, given the magnitude of the balance of payments need incases qualifying for this facility. •T h e Contingent Credit Lines (CCLs) are not subject to access limits but commitments under the CCL are expected to be in the range of 300–500 per-cent of quota. CCL resources are provided under Stand-By Arrangements, incombination with credit tranche resources up to the annual or the cumulativelimit. As with the SRF, the liquidity position of the IMF is taken into accountwhen determining access under the CCL. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 32policy measures that are considered necessary to resolve underlying balance of payments problems and enable members to repay the IMF within theestablished repurchase period. Phasing also enables the purchasing member to demonstrate to other members that its adjustment program is being implemented and warrants their continued support. The choice between even phasing and uneven phasing depends on the bal- ance of payments need and the path of adjustment. These choices are made on a case-by-case basis: resources are normally fairly evenly spread over thearrangement period but a concentration of adjustment at the beginning of an arrangement could justify front-loading of purchases. The frequency of purchases may also be affected by the length of lags in the reporting of datarelating to performance criteria. 14 Repurchase Policies The repurchase policies of the IMF are intended to ensure the revolving character of its resources. All purchases made from the IMF are subject topredetermined repurchase schedules (Table II.2). The length of the repur- chase period and the number of repurchase installments differ according to the policy or facility under which the credit was extended. In the case of most purchases, a borrower is expected to repurchase ear- lier than the schedule of repurchase obligations. Such time-based repurchase expectations are aimed at securing early repayment from members in a posi-tion to do so, in keeping with a long-standing principle of the IMF that its resources should be used only as long as there is a balance of payments need (Box II.3). A waiver of early repurchase expectations can be provided bythe Executive Board upon the request of a member, if the member’s exter- nal position is not strong enough for the member to pay early without undue hardship or risk. In case of a waiver, repurchases would fall due according tothe original obligation schedule. Time-based repurchase expectations apply to purchases made after November 28, 2000 in the credit tranches and under the CFF and EFF. For purchases in the credit tranches and under the CFF, the expectation schedule is 1 year in advance of the obligation schedule, beginning 2¼ years after eachpurchase and ending after 4 years. For the EFF, the expectation schedule 14Specific guidelines on phasing are set out in Selected Decisions and Selected Docu- ments of the International Monetary Fund (Washington).

The basic rate of charge therefore fluctuates with the market rate for the SDR, which is calculated on a weekly basis. The basic rate of charge is adjusted upward for burden sharing to compensate for the overdue charges of other members (see Box II.9). The Surcharge on high levels of credit outstanding under the credit tranches and the EFF is designed to discourage large use of IMF resources. The SRF and CCL surcharges increase with the time elapsed since the first SRF or CCL purchase, which sharpens the incentive for repurchases ahead of the obligation schedule. The annual commitment fee applies to amounts available under an arrangment during the year. The fee is refunded to the extent that available amounts are purchased.Repurchases are made in equal installments at regular intervals over a fixed period. A member is free to repurchase in advance of maturity and to attribute repurchases to any outstanding obligation to the IMF. The repurchase obligation schedule for each type of credit is generally associated with an accelerated schedule, which members are expected to follow. A member not in a position to meet the expectations schedule can request an extension up to the corresponding period in the obligation schedule. 33 FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 34BOX II.3. E VOLUTION OF IMF P OLICIES ON REPURCHASES Under the original Articles of Agreement, there were no fixed repurchase periods for the use of IMF resources: repurchases were calculated annually foreach member according to a formula based on their international reserves. This reflected the principle that the IMF’s resources are made available only to members with a balance of payments and reserve need, and was designed toensure their revolving character. This approach became unworkable over time, however, and was increasingly supplemented by policies on repurchase periods. The coexistence of these two approaches—one based on explicit schedules and another on reserve strength—was codified under the Second Amendment of the Articles in 1978with the establishment of fixed repurchase periods (Article V , Section 7 (c)) and provision for early repurchase by members as their balance of paymentsand reserve position improves (Article V , Section 7 (b)). A major change in the repurchase policies was introduced in 1997 with the establishment of the SRF to help members experiencing exceptional balance of payments di ff iculties owi ng to a large short- term fi nancing need resulti ngfrom a sudden and disruptive loss of market confidence. In line with the short-term nature of this type of balance of payments need, the SRF incorporatesmuch shorter repurchase periods and features repurchase expectations thatare legally outside of the framework of Article V, Section 7 (b). Repurchases under the SRF are expected to be made in two installments after 1 and 1½ years from the date of the purchase. In order to provide flexibility for caseswhere the member’s return to capital markets takes longer than anticipated,each repurchase can be extended by up to 1 year, upon request by the memberand approval of the request by the Executive Board. The same repurchase pro-file was adopted for the CCL in 1999. Repurchase expectations were introduced for purchases in the credit tranches and under the EFF and the CFF in November 2000. These time-basedrepurchase expectations (see Table II.2) can be extended upon request by themember, in which case repurchases would fall due according to the originalo b l i g a t i o n s c h e d u l e . W a i v e r s a r e c o n s i d e r e d b y t h e E x e c u t i v e B o a r d i f t h emember’s external position is not strong enough for the member to pay early without undue hardship or risk. Adjustment programs supported by credit tranche or EFF resources are generally designed on the basis of the obligationschedule for repurchases, so that in most cases members will be in a position tomeet repurchase expectations only if their external position is stronger thanprojected at the outset of the program. In contrast, adjustment programs sup-ported by SRF and CCL resources are designed on the basis of the expectation schedule from repurchases. II General Department 35begins after 4½ years, as with the obligation schedule, but repurchases are doubled, so that the expectation schedule ends after 7 years rather than 10years under the obligation schedule. Figure II.3 illustrates the mapping of repurchase expectations and the corresponding repurchase obligations. A member can request an extension of time-based repurchase expecta- tions if its external position is not sufficiently strong. If the IMF agrees to an extension, all repurchase expectations during the period covered by the extension would revert back to the corresponding repurchase obligations.There is a presumption that this period would be one year, although a longer or shorter period could be set. If the IMF does not agree to an extension, the member would be expected to make repurchases according to the expecta-tion schedule. Failure to do so would result in a suspension of the right to make further purchases, including prospective purchases under an existing arrangement. However, the member would not be in arrears until it failed tomeet a repurchase obligation. IMF-supported programs are guided by the requirement that the member should be able to meet repurchase obligations. In most cases, therefore, mem-bers will be considered to be in a position to meet repurchase expectations only if their external position is stronger than had been projected at the time of approval of the associated IMF arrangement. Similarly, the evaluation ofmembers’ capacity to repay the IMF is based on the obligation schedule. An early repurchase policy serves as a backstop to the standard repur- chase provisions. Members with IMF credit outstanding are normally expected to make repurchases as their balance of payments and reserve position improves. 15 A member could experience an especially rapid and strong turnaround in its balance of payments and reserve position, and maybe in a position to make repurchases earlier than under the fixed schedulesfor time-based repurchase expectations. In addition, there are some pur-chases for which time-based repurchase expectations are not applicable. 16 Judgments on the appropriateness of early repurchases in individual casesare made by the Executive Board. The amount of such repurchases expectedduring a given quarter is determined on the basis of a formula that reliesheavily on gross reserves (Box II.4). 15Article V, Section 7 (b). 16Time-based repurchase expectations do not apply to purchases made prior to Novem- ber 2000 or to purchases under emergency assistance; separate repurchase expectationsapply to purchases under the CCL and SRF.

II General Department 37BOX II.4. E ARLY REPURCHASE POLICY : MINIMUM REPURCHASE AMOUNTS Formula Under the guidelines for early repurchase, the minimum amount that a member is expected to repurchase each quarter is determined by a formulabased on the member’s gross international reserves: • 1.5 percent of latest reserves plus (minus) • 5.0 percent of the increase (decrease) in reserves over the previous six months. For this purpose, the IMF uses the latest data on the member’s gross reserves as reported in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics , with gold valued at SDR 35 an ounce, available when the associated financial transac- tions plan is prepared for Executive Board consideration. The formula thus ensures a tight link between reserves and repayments to the IMF, with anyincrease in reserves resulting in larger repurchases and vice versa. The formulais applied anew for every quarter the member is included in the transactionsplan for early repurchases. Limits The minimum repurchase amount is subject to quantitative limits. This amount cannot • exceed 4 percent of latest reserves in a quarter,• exceed 10 percent of latest reserves in a year, or• reduce latest reserves below 250 percent of quota. These limits are a means to protect members from having to draw too heavily on their owned reserves to meet IMF repayments. In the two decadessince the policy was established, early repurchase amounts generated by theformula have always fallen below these limits. Credits In addition to these limits, the minimum repurchase amount is reduced to the extent of any repurchase obligations falling due during the quarter or togive credit for voluntary advance repurchases: • in the two quarters prior to the member being included for early repur- chase, or • subsequent repurchases in excess of minimum repurchase amounts. The credits are intended to encourage members to accelerate repurchases voluntarily on their own terms. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 38Early repurchase expectations can arise in other contexts. Provisions for early repurchase are built into the CFF, Contingent Credit Line (CCL), andSupplemental Reserve Facility (SRF). In addition, a member is required totake corrective action by making an early repurchase in the event that itmakes a purchase under an arrangement that it was not entitled to make bythe terms of the arrangement —that is, a noncomplying purchase. The requirement of corrective action can be waived if the IMF decides that thecircumstances justify continued use of the purchased resources. A noncom-plying purchase would arise if a member were permitted to make a purchasebecause, on the basis of information available at the time, the IMF was satis- fied that the conditions applicable to the purchase under the arrangement had been observed but, on the basis of information subsequently available, itbecame evident that the conditions of the arrangement had not actuallybeen met. 17 The IMF can change the period of repurchases.18 It has the authority to postpone the date for the discharge of a repurchase by a majority of thevotes cast, provided that the postponement does not cause the repurchase toexceed the maximum repurchase period. Postponement beyond the maxi- mum period allowed under the arrangement would be considered only in the event that the IMF determined that discharge on the due date wouldresult in exceptional hardship for the member and if the longer period forrepurchase is consistent with the revolving nature of the use of IMFresources. Such a decision requires approval by a 70 percent majority of thetotal voting power. 19 A member is free to make advance repurchases at any time. At the discre- tion of the member, advance repurchases can be attributed to any outstand- ing purchases. In this way, a member is free to reduce the IMF’s holdings of its currency corresponding to prior purchases and thereby reduce or elimi-nate its obligation to pay interest to the IMF. Repurchases can be made, atthe choice of the repurchasing member, in SDRs or in currencies selected bythe IMF according to the policies and procedures for the use and receipt of 17See also the discussion in Chapter V on “Measures to Deal with Misreporting.” 18An 85 percent majority of the total voting power in the IMF is required to change the period of repurchase of holdings of currency acquired by the IMF pursuant to its policy onthe use of general resources. A 70 percent majority is required in the case of holdings of currency not acquired as a result of purchases and subject to charges under Article V , Sec- tion 8 (b)(ii). See Appendix II. 19No such decision has been taken in the past 25 years. II General Department 39currencies under the quarterly financial transactions plan, as discussed below under “Financial Transactions Plan.”20 Financial Policies and Facilities The lending instruments of the IMF have evolved over the years. In its early years, IMF lending took place exclusively on the basis of general poli-cies on access in what became known as the credit tranches and, in particu- lar, under Stand-By Arrangements. Beginning in the 1960s, special policies were developed to deal with various balance of payments problems havingparticular causes, resulting over time in a multiplicity of policies on the use of IMF resources. 21 Special policies on the use of IMF resources outside the credit tranches are generally referred to as facilities. All decisions on the extension of IMF credit are taken by the Executive Board. These decisions are supported by a formal request from the member and an assessment by the staff of the nature and magnitude of the balance ofpayments problem, the adequacy of the policy response, and the capacity of the member to repay the IMF. In 1995, the IMF specified streamlined proce- dures under an Emergency Financing Mechanism to allow for quicker Exec-utive Board approval of IMF financial support. This mechanism is used in circumstances representing, or threatening, a crisis in a member’s external accounts that requires an immediate response from the IMF, as was the casein 1997 for Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand and in July 1998 for Russia. A fundamental review of IMF financial policies and facilities took place in 2000, which resulted in a more streamlined structure, with a sharper focus on crisis prevention and ensuring effective use of IMF resources. This section describes the current structure of policies and facilities; earlier lendinginstruments are noted in Box II.5. 20Members have the option of combining all repurchases due within a calendar month, provided that the combined repurchase is completed not later than the last day of the month and that no single repurchase remains outstanding for a period exceeding the maxi-mum permitted under the relevant policy of the IMF. 21A comprehensive discussion of the evolution of IMF lending instruments is available on the web: “Review of Facilities—Preliminary Considerations,” www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/fac/2000/index.htm. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 40Credit Tranche Policies From its early history, IMF credit was made available in tranches (seg- ments). Members could make purchases in four credit tranches, each equiva- lent to 25 percent of quota, within the prevailing annual access limit of 25percent of quota and the cumulative access limit of 100 percent of quota. ABOX II.5. E ARLIER IMF L ENDING INSTRUMENTS Over the years, the IMF has established a number of policies and facilities to meet particular balance of payments needs that were eventually either elimi- nated or allowed to lapse: •T h e Buffer Stock Financing Facility , created in 1969 and eliminated in 2000, provided financing to members to help finance their contributions toapproved commodity price stabilization funds. •T h e f i r s t Oil Facility was created in June 1974 in response to the oil price shock, and lapsed in December 1974. A second Oil Facility was created in April 1975 to provide additional financing, and lapsed in March 1976. • A policy of support for debt and debt-service operations , initiated in 1989, was a key element of the IMF’s response to the debt crisis. The policy proveduseful in facilitating commercial bank debt reduction but, by the late 1990s, had outlived its usefulness and was discontinued in 2000. •A n oil import element was added to the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) in November 1990, when oil prices rose sharply during the Middle East conflict. It was allowed to lapse at end-1991. •T h e Systemic Transformation Facility , created in April 1993 and allowed to lapse in April 1995, provided support for the early stages of transition from centrally planned to market economies, in relatively small amounts and with relatively low conditionality. • The policy on currency stabilization funds w a s e s t a b l i s h e d i n 1 9 9 5 a s a means of providing additional, precautionary support under IMF arrange- ments during the early stage of an exchange rate–based stabilization program.No member made use of the policy, and it was discontinued in 2000. •A contingency element was added to the CFF in 1988. Until its elimination in 2000, this instrument provided additional access under arrangements,according to prespecified calculations, in the event of unanticipated adverse current account developments. •T h e Y2K Facility was created in September 1999 to deal with possible strains resulting from the Millennium (Y2K) computer dating problem. It was not used, and lapsed in March 2000. II General Department 41purchase in the first credit tranche raises the use of IMF credit to no more than 25 percent of quota. The three subsequent tranches are known as the upper credit tranches. Over time, access to IMF credit substantially above100 percent of quota under the credit tranches has been permitted; accord-ingly, the upper credit tranches now refer more generally to any use of IMF credit beyond the first credit tranche. Resources drawn in the credit tranches can be used to meet any balance of payments need. The segmentation in terms of first and upper credit tranches underscores the basic principle that the IMF requires stronger justification in terms ofpolicy understandings from the member at higher levels of IMF credit out-standing. Conditionality is the mechanism that gives the IMF the needed assurances. The IMF adopts a more liberal attitude in making resources available in the first credit tranche than in the upper credit tranches, pro-vided that the member is making reasonable efforts to solve its balance ofpayments problems. Requests for use of IMF resources beyond the first credit tranche require substantial justification for the expectation that the member’s balance of payments difficulties will be resolved within a reason-able period of time. Access to the upper credit tranches is normally made under Stand-By Arrangements. These are lines of credit from the IMF under which a “mem-ber is assured that it will be able to make purchases from the General Resources Account in accordance with the terms of the decision during a specified period and up to a specified amount.” 22 Stand-By Arrangements have long been the core lending instrument of the institution. They were ini-tially intended as precautionary instruments, to be drawn on only if pay- ments difficulties emerged, but have been used more commonly as a source of external financing. Stand-By Arrangements that are treated by membersas precautionary, either at the outset of the arrangement or after immediate financing constraints have eased, have again emerged following the opening of world capital markets. Stand-By Arrangements typically cover a period of 1–1½ years but can be longer, up to a maximum of 3 years. Performance criteria, the phasing of pur-chases, and program reviews apply to the use of IMF resources in the uppercredit tranches, but not in the first credit tranche, even under a Stand-By Arrangement. 23 Repurchases are expected each quarter 2¼–4 years after 22Article XXX (b). 23Outright purchases without IMF arrangements can take place, but are rare. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 42each purchase, but these expectations can be extended to a maximum repur- chase period of 3¼–5 years. In addition to the charges for the use of IMF credit, members pay a commitment fee for Stand-By Arrangements, which is refunded to the extent that amounts under the arrangement are purchased(Table II.2 summarizes the terms of IMF credit under the various policiesand facilities). Extended Fund Facility The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) was established in 1974 as a vehicle for longer-term external financing for members undertaking needed structuraleconomic reforms. The EFF is designed for economies: • suffering serious payments imbalances relating to structural maladjust- ments in production and trade and where price and cost distortionshave been widespread, or • characterized by slow growth and an inherently weak balance of pay- ments position, which prevent pursuit of an active development policy. The EFF is especially appropriate for members graduating from the Pov- erty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) programs or transition econo-mies that lack adequate capital market access. At the same time, the EFFand all other IMF facilities are available in principle to any member that meets the eligibility criteria. Members drawing under the EFF do so in the context of an Extended Arrangement. These are three-year IMF arrangements, which can be extended for a fourth year. Performance criteria and purchases typically fol- low a semiannual schedule. Repurchases are also made semiannually, andover a longer period than applies to the credit tranches: repurchases areexpected 4½–7 years after each purchase but this can be extended to themaximum repurchase period of 4½–10 years. Members pay a refundable commitment fee for Extended Arrangements, as well as the applicable charges for the use of IMF credit. Supplemental Reserve Facility The Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) was established at the end of 1997, at the height of the Asian financial crisis. Its purpose is to provide financial assistance to members experiencing exceptional balance of pay-ments difficulties due to a large, short-term financing need following a sud-den and disruptive loss of confidence reflected in pressure on the capitalaccount and the member’s foreign reserves. Access under the SRF is separate II General Department 43from the limits that apply to the credit tranches and the EFF, and it has no explicit limits of its own. SRF resources are provided under Stand-By or Extended Arrangements. The conditionality in an arrangement involvingSRF resources is that of the associated Stand-By or Extended Arrangement. The repurchase period for SRF resources is much shorter than that gov- erning the credit tranches and EFF, reflecting the likelihood of a quickerturnaround in the balance of payments. Repurchases are made in twoinstallments and are expected 1–1½ years after each purchase; this period can be extended up to the maximum repurchase period of 2–2½ years.Resources drawn under the SRF are subject to the basic rate of chargeapplying to all IMF credit and a specific surcharge. During the first yearfrom the date of the first purchase under the facility, the SRF surcharge is setat 300 basis points, and it rises by 50 basis points at the end of the first yearand every six months thereafter, up to a maximum of 500 basis points. Thestandard commitment fee for Stand-By Arrangements applies. Contingent Credit Lines The Contingent Credit Line (CCL) is a new type of lending instrument for the IMF. Conceived in the midst of a series of severe financial crises involv- ing large-scale use of IMF resources by a number of members, the CCL wasestablished by the IMF in 1999 as a means of preventing the spread of capi-tal account–driven crises. The CCL is intended to provide members main- taining strong policies with a precautionary line of defense against balanceof payments problems arising from international financial contagion.Although it draws on IMF experience over several decades, the CCL has anumber of novel features that set it apart from other IMF lending instru-ments, notably an element of pre-qualification and automaticity in usingIMF resources. The CCL is subject to demanding eligibility requirements: • the absence of an immediate need to use IMF resources at the time of approval; • a positive assessment of policies by the IMF, taking into account the member’s adherence to internationally accepted standards (especiallythe IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard or SDDS); • constructive relations with private creditors, with a view to facilitating appropriate involvement of the private sector, and satisfactory manage-ment of external vulnerability; and FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 44• a satisfactory economic and financial program, which the member stands ready to adjust as needed. As with the SRF, CCL resources are provided under Stand-By Arrange- ments, in combination with credit tranche resources. Access to CCL resources is expected to be in the range of 300–500 percent of quota, and does not count toward the access limits for the credit tranches and the EFF. Upon approval of an arrangement with CCL resources, a small amount is made available but is not expected to be purchased. If a crisis strikes, the member may request the completion of an activation review, at which the Executive Board would ascertain that the member is affected by a crisis stemming from contagion and that the member’s own policies had not been a significant cause of the pressures in its balance of payments. There is a pre- sumption that one-third of the amount committed under the CCL would be released at this time. The phasing and conditionality for the remaining CCL resources would be specified in a post-activation review concluded shortly after or together with the activation review; conditionality would be expected to cover macroeconomic rather than structural policies, given thenature of the balance of payments difficulties. The financial terms for CCL resources are identical to those governing SRF resources, except that the surcharge on CCL resources over the basic rate of charge is 150 basis points lower: the CCL surcharge is 150 basis points initially, rising by 50 basis points one year after the first purchase and every six months thereafter, up to a maximum surcharge of 350 basis points. The commitment fee for the CCL is the same as for the SRF. Compensatory Financing Facility The CFF was the first facility aimed at helping members deal with special balance of payments problems. It was established in the 1960s to ensure timely external financing for members experiencing balance of payments difficulties resulting from a temporary decline in export earnings. A cereal import element was added in 1981; two other elements introduced since the establishment of the CFF have been removed (see Box II.5). In addition to having a balance of payments need related to export shortfalls or excess cereal import costs, the eligibility requirements include the following: • the export shortfall or excess cereal import cost are of a short-term character; • the shortfall or excess must be largely attributable to factors beyond the member’s control; and II General Department 45• if the member has balance of payments difficulties beyond the effect of the shortfall or excess, it must have a new or existing arrangement inplace at the time of the request for a CFF purchase. Access under the CFF is subject to its own limits, and does not count toward the access limits under the credit tranches and the EFF. The CFFaccess limits range from 45 percent of quota for each of the export shortfall and excess cereal import costs elements to a combined limit of 55 percent of quota. Within these limits, actual access is determined by the size of theshortfall or excess, and may be limited by concerns about the member’s abil- ity to repay the IMF. Access under the CFF counts toward the threshold for upper credit tranche conditionality —that is, the CFF does not “float” as regards conditionality.24 Under certain circumstances, purchases under the CFF may be phased, with purchases subsequent to the initial purchase being conditioned on themember’s having an IMF arrangement in place and meeting all the condi- tions for a purchase or disbursement under that arrangement. They are sub- ject to the same terms as credit tranche resources with respect to charges,repurchase expectations, and repurchase obligations; CFF purchases do not carry a surcharge, however, and do not count toward the calculation of sur- charges applying to IMF credit outstanding in excess of 200 percent ofquota. In addition to the time-based early repurchase expectations, the CFF incorporates additional specific early repurchase provisions. If a membermakes a purchase on the basis of estimated data for the shortfall in export earnings or excess in cereal import costs, and if the actual data, once they are available, indicate that the purchase exceeded the amount that would havebeen available had actual data been used, the member is expected to repur- chase promptly an amount equivalent to the difference. Emergency Assistance The IMF has a long-standing policy of providing financial assistance to members experiencing emergencies. The conditionality associated with IMF lending for this purpose is similar to that required for purchases in the first 24In practice, this means that a member with 25 percent of quota or more of credit out- standing under the CFF cannot access the credit tranches with first credit tranche (lower)conditionality. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 46credit tranche. Two basic types of emergencies are covered by this policy: natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes; and post- conflict situations, following social disruptions. Emergency assistance for natural disasters is available where the member cannot meet its immediate financing needs arising from a natural disaster without serious depletion of its foreign reserves. If this exigency were not present, however, IMF assistance for these members could be provided under the CFF or a Stand-By or an Extended Arrangement. The policy con- ditions include a statement of the general policies the member intends to pursue, and some assurance that the member will cooperate with the IMF in an effort to find, where appropriate, solutions for its balance of payments difficulties. In post-conflict situations, emergency assistance can be made available where there is an urgent balance of payments need and a role for the IMF in catalyzing support from others, but where the institutional and administra- tive capacity of the member has been disrupted as a result of social conflict, so that the member is not yet able to develop and implement a comprehen- sive economic program that could be supported by an IMF arrangement. In these circumstances, there must nevertheless be sufficient capacity for plan- ning and policy implementation and a demonstrated commitment by the authorities. Support from the IMF in these cases must be part of a concerted international effort to address the aftermath of the conflict situation in a comprehensive way. IMF assistance in emergency situations was initially provided through the flexible application of policies on the use of the credit tranches, but since 2000 has been subject to a special policy outside the credit tranches. Access is nor- mally limited to 25 percent of quota. Larger amounts can be made available on an exceptional basis: a further 25 percent of quota can be provided in post- conflict situations where progress on capacity rebuilding has been slow andthe member is not in a position to move to an IMF arrangement after one year but where there is sufficient evidence of the authorities’ commitment to reform and capacity to implement policies; tranching of disbursements may be appropriate in these cases. Purchases under emergency assistance are subject to the basic rate of charge and a maximum repurchase period of 3¼–5 years, but are not subject to time-based repurchase expectations and do not count toward the calculation of the surcharge on IMF credit in excess of 200 percent of quota. The IMF has set up a special administered account with the purpose of providing PRGF-eligible  with post-conflict emergency assistance II General Department 47at the concessional rate of interest of ½ of 1 percent a year (see Appendix III.) To achieve this objective, adequate donor resources will need to be mobilized. The amounts of IMF credit outstanding by facility during 1990–2000 are shown in Figure II.4. Currency Holdings In the balance sheet of the GRA, the IMF distinguishes between usable currencies and other currencies. Usable currencies comprise the currencies of those member  that have a sufficiently strong balance of pay-ments and reserve positions for their currencies to be used to provide creditto other members. These currency holdings represent the bulk of resources available to meet the future demand for IMF credit. Other currencies include the currencies of members with weaker external positions that arenot being used for credit purposes, although they could become usable if themembers’ balance of payments positions improved, and the currencies of borrowers. Valuation of Currencies Currencies and securities held in the GRA’s pool of resources are valued in terms of the SDR on the basis of each member’s representative rate of exchange. Each member is obligated to maintain, in SDR terms, the value ofthe balances of the IMF’s holdings of its currency in the GRA, but not thoseheld elsewhere by the IMF, such as in the SDA or the Administered Accounts. 25 The total SDR value of the IMF’s holdings of currencies in the GRA is kept constant through changes to the amount of members’ currencybalances. A member has to pay in additional currency if its currency depreci-ates against the SDR, and the IMF will refund some of these currency hold-ings if the currency appreciates. This requirement is referred to as the maintenance-of-value obligation. Because of this obligation the IMF’s resources are insulated from exchange rate fluctuations. A member’s currency held by the IMF is revalued in SDR terms whenever: • the currency is used by the IMF in a transaction with another member, • at the end of the IMF’s financial year (April 30), 25Revaluation changes in members’ currencies in relation to the SDR in the other IMF accounts (the SDA and the Administered Accounts) are reported as valuation gains andlosses for those accounts.

II General Department 49• at the request of a member during the year, for example, at the end of the member’s financial year; and • on such other occasions as the IMF may decide. Whenever it becomes necessary to adjust the rate at which the IMF has recorded the use of a member’s currency, the new rate becomes effective inthe IMF’s accounts at the close of business on the date that the newexchange rate is determined. All holdings of a member’s currency in the GRA, including any unsettled obligations resulting from an earlier revalua-tion, are revalued at the new rate. The new rate is applied to all transactionsin that currency, including administrative receipts and payments, until such atime as the rate may again need to be adjusted. The currency valuation adjustments are part of the IMF’s holdings of members’ currencies. Whenever the IMF revalues its holdings of a member’s currency, reflecting a change in its exchange rate with the SDR, an accountreceivable or an account payable is established for the amount of currencypayable by or to the member in order to maintain the value of holdings ofthe member’s currency in terms of the SDR. SDR Holdings The IMF does not receive allocations of SDRs, but obtains its SDRs as payment of the reserve asset portion of quota subscriptions and in settle- ment of charges and, to a lesser degree, repayment of credit. The IMF, in turn, uses these SDRs to pay interest on creditor positions and to providecredit to members. Since SDRs were created as a supplement to existing reserve assets, the IMF does not maintain large holdings of SDRs for long periods of time, but rather recirculates the SDRs it receives back to themembership. The SDR system, and the key role of the GRA in the circula- tion of SDRs, is discussed in Chapter III. Gold Holdings The IMF holds 103 million fine (troy) ounces (3,217 metric tons) of gold at designated official depositories, making it the third largest official holder of gold after the United States and Germany. IMF holdings account for about 10 percent of total official gold stocks. The IMF acquired its gold in variousways (Box II.6). The IMF’s gold holdings are valued on its balance sheet on the basis of historical cost, with a book value of SDR 5.9 billion. Valued at end-April 2001 market prices, the IMF’s holdings amount to over SDR 21billion (about $27 billion). FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 50BOX II.6. S OURCES AND USES OF THE IMF’ S GOLD The IMF acquired virtually all its gold holdings through four main types of transactions under the pre-Second Amendment (1978) Articles of Agreement. •Subscriptions . The original Articles of Agreement prescribed that 25 per- cent of initial subscriptions and quota increases was normally to be paid ingold. This represented the largest source of the IMF’s gold. •Payment of charges . Originally, all charges, or interest, on members’ out- standing use of IMF credit were normally payable in gold. •Repurchases . Members could use gold to repay the IMF for credit previ- ously extended. •Purchases . A member wishing to obtain the currency of another member could acquire it by selling gold to the IMF. The major use of this provision wassales of gold to the IMF by South Africa in 1970–71. Outf lows of gold f rom the IMF’ s hol di ngs occurred under the pre-Second Amendment (1978) Articles of Agreement through sales of gold for currency,and via payment of remuneration and interest. Sales of gold for currency wereas follows: •Sales for replenishment (1957–70) . In the late 1950s and in the 1960s, the IMF sold gold on several occasions to replenish its holdings of currencies. •South African gold and mitigation . In the early 1970s, the IMF sold gold to members in amounts roughly corresponding to the amounts purchased earlierfrom South Africa; it also sold gold in connection with payments of gold forquota increases by some members, in order to mitigate the impact of these pay-ments on the gold holdings of reserve centers. •Investment in U.S. Government securities (1956–72) . In order to generate income to offset operational deficits, some gold was sold to the United Statesand the proceeds invested in U.S. Government securities. A significant buildupof reserves through income from charges prompted the IMF to reacquire thisgold from the U.S. Government in the early 1970s. •Auctions and “restitution” sales (1976–80) . The IMF sold approximately one-third (50 million ounces) of its then-existing gold holdings following anagreement by its members to reduce the role of gold in the international mon-etary system. Half of this amount was sold in restitution to members at thethen-official price of SDR 35 an ounce; the other half was auctioned to themarket to finance the Trust Fund, which supported concessional lending by theIMF to low-income . Since 1980, the IMF has had few transactions in gold. A very small amount of gold was received from Cambodia in 1992 in discharge of its overdue obligations.In 1993, the IMF pledged to sell up to 3 million ounces of gold if the resources ofthe PRGF Trust Reserve Account were insufficient to cover repayments toPRGF creditors resulting from loans made to encash rights under the rightsaccumulation approach. Finally, during 1999–2000, the IMF conducted a seriesof off-market transactions in gold that left its gold holdings unchanged, in orderto generate resources to help finance its participation in the HIPC Initiative. II General Department 51Gold in the Articles of Agreement Before the Second Amendment of the Articles in April 1978, the role of gold in the IMF and in the international monetary system was central andpervasive. The Second Amendment contained a number of provisions that,in combination, were intended to achieve a gradual reduction of the role ofgold in the international monetary system and in the IMF. The Second Amendment: • eliminated the use of gold as the common denominator of the par value system and as the basis of the value of the SDR; • abolished the official price of gold and abolished the obligatory uses of gold in transactions between the IMF and its members; • required the IMF, in its dealings in gold, to avoid managing its price or establishing a fixed price of gold; and • included an undertaking by members to collaborate with the IMF and other members with respect to reserve assets to promote better interna-tional surveillance of international liquidity. The Articles now limit the use of gold in the IMF’s transactions. Any transactions in gold by the IMF require a decision by an 85 percent majority of the total voting power in the IMF. The IMF: • may sell gold outright on the basis of prevailing market prices;• may accept gold in the discharge of a member’s obligations to the IMF at an agreed price on the basis of prices in the market at the time of acceptance; • does not have the authority to engage in any other gold transactions, for example, loans, leases, swaps, or use of gold as collateral; and • does not have the authority to buy gold. The IMF’s Policy on Gold The IMF’s policies on gold are governed by the following five principles: • As an undervalued asset held by the IMF, gold provides fundamental strength to its balance sheet. Any mobilization of IMF gold should avoid weakening its overall financial position. • Gold holdings provide the IMF with operational maneuverability both as regards the use of its resources and through adding credibility to its precautionary balances. In these respects, the benefits of the IMF’s gold holdings are passed on to the membership at large, including both cred- itors and debtors. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 52• The IMF should continue to hold a relatively large amount of gold among its assets, not only for prudential reasons, but also to meetunforeseen contingencies. • The IMF has a systemic responsibility to avoid causing disruptions to the functioning of the gold market. • Profits from any gold sales should be retained in an investment fund, and only the investment income should be used for any purposes thatmay be agreed upon by the IMF members. The IMF’s Gold Since 1980 Uses of the IMF’s gold have occurred on two occasions since 1980 without changing the IMF’s long-term holdings of gold. As was the case with the open-market auctions of gold in 1976–80, these uses of gold were for thebenefit of the poorest members of the IMF. Toward this end, the IMFpledged gold in 1993 and decided in 1999 to conduct off-market transactionsof gold. Gold Pledge To reassure creditors to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) that they would be repaid for ESAF (now PRGF) loans made toencash rights under the “rights accumulation approach,” it was agreed, if necessary, to mobilize some of the IMF’s gold. For this purpose, in 1993 the IMF decided —with the required 85 percent majority of the total voting power —to sell up to 3 million ounces of gold if it were determined that the resources in the PRGF Trust Reserve Account (plus other available meansof financing) were insufficient to meet payments to be made from that account to PRGF creditors. The shortfall would be covered by gold sales to the extent of previous drawings on the Reserve Account attributable tooverdue repayments by borrowers of loans for the encashment of rights, plusthe interest earnings forgone on such drawings. It is difficult to assess the likelihood that the gold pledge for rights encash- ments under PRGF arrangements would be drawn on in the future, mainlybecause of uncertainty about future borrowings under the rights approach.Sierra Leone and Zambia still have loans outstanding to the PRGF Trustunder the rights approach, but these loans are rapidly diminishing either because they are coming close to maturity or because they are covered under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. It is, therefore, highly unlikely that the gold II General Department 53pledge would be activated in connection with these loans. Moreover, the gold pledge could not be called upon until after the resources of the ReserveAccount of the PRGF Trust were exhausted. 26 Nevertheless, three coun- tries—Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan —remain eligible for the rights approach and could conceivably borrow sizable sums from the PRGF in con-nection with rights encashments at some time in the future, provided the Executive Board continues to extend the availability of the rights approach. Whether these  will follow the rights approach to arrears clearanceis uncertain. In any case, the earliest rights encashments could not take place for a few years and repayment of those PRGF loans would only commence five and half years after such disbursements. Off-Market Transactions in Gold To help finance its contribution to the HIPC Initiative, the IMF in 1999– 2000 conducted a series of off-market transactions in gold. During December1999–April 2000, the IMF sold a total of 12.944 million fine ounces of gold toBrazil and Mexico at the prevailing market price on the day of each transac-tion. The total amount sold was equivalent to SDR 2.7 billion ($3.7 billion).After each sale, the gold was immediately accepted back by the IMF at thesame price in settlement of financial obligations of these members to theIMF. The net effect of these transactions left the IMF’s holdings of physical gold unchanged, but the gold accepted back was included in the IMF’s bal-ance sheet at the market price of the transactions, instead of at the originalprice of SDR 35 a fine ounce. In accordance with the Articles, the equivalent of SDR 35 a fine ounce from the proceeds of the sales was retained in the GRA. The proceeds inexcess of this amount (totaling SDR 2.2 billion, or about $2.9 billion) areheld in the SDA and invested. The income from these investments, whichwill be transferred to the PRGF-HIPC Trust when needed, will be used tohelp finance the IMF’s contribution to the HIPC Initiative. In this context,the Board of Governors of the IMF adopted a resolution in September 1999stating that the off-market gold transactions would “be a one-time operationof a highly exceptional nature.” These gold transactions affected the IMF’s balance sheet and income as follows: 26The Reserve Account of the PRGF Trust is discussed in Chapter IV. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 54• The IMF’s holdings of usable currencies in the GRA were lower, and reserve tranche positions higher, than they would otherwise have beenby the amount of profit (SDR 2.2 billion). This is because Brazil andMexico paid in gold instead of usable currencies, which would havebeen used to reduce reserve tranche positions of creditor members. • The IMF’s net income is affected by the remuneration expense on the continuing enlarged reserve tranche positions. The additional remuner-ation expense varies with the rate of remuneration, and amounted to anestimated SDR 94 million in FY2001. For comparison, the IMF’s netincome target for FY2001, the first year in which the full income effectof the off-market gold transactions was felt, was SDR 48 million, andfor FY2002 net income is targeted at SDR 51 million. While the transactions were successful in that they allowed the IMF to contribute to the resolution of the debt problems of the HIPCs, theyresulted in an increase in the IMF’s cost of operations. Since, under standardprocedures (see the discussion of “Operational Income” below), this rela- tively large increase in cost would have resulted in a higher rate of charge,the cost increase was mitigated or offset through the existing burden-sharingmechanism and placed in the SCA-1. In the same way, SDR 94 million isbeing generated in FY2002. Quotas Each member of the IMF is assigned a quota and pays a capital subscrip- tion to the IMF that is equal to its quota. As noted earlier, a quarter of a member’s quota subscription is normally paid in reserve assets, with theremainder paid in the member’s own currency. 27 Quotas are expressed in SDRs and their size is determined by the IMF’s Board of Governors,broadly on the basis of the economic size of the country, and taking intoaccount quotas of similar . To help in this determination, five for- mulas are used that relate the quota to the size of the country’s GDP , current account transactions, and official reserves. As of April 30, 2001, total quotas 27The IMF has made arrangements to assist members with insufficient reserves to pay the reserve asset portion of their quota subscription payment through a same-day, no-costIMF lending operation (see Chapter III, Box III.4).The Resource and Liability Side II General Department 55of all members amounted to SDR 212.4 billion. A list of members and their quotas is provided in Appendix I. Members’ quotas constitute the financial base of the IMF and determine its size, as well as serve other functions as determined by the IMF’s Articles. • Quotas provide the vast bulk of reserve assets that can be used in the provision of foreign reserves by the IMF, despite the availability of bor- rowed resources and the growing role of administered resources to pro- vide concessional assistance to the IMF’s poorest members. • Quotas determine the distribution of voting power in the IMF.28 Quo- tas determine members’ financial relationships with the IMF and,through the effect on voting power, members’ roles in IMF decision- making and representation on the Executive Board. Many decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, though special voting majorities are required for some important financial decisions (Appendix II). • Quotas continue to play a crucial role in determining the demand for IMF resources. Quotas serve as the basis for access to such resources in the great majority of IMF-supported programs, subject to limits set by theArticles and the Executive Board. 29 Over the years, however, the rela- tionship between quotas and access has become more elastic, especially as the demand for IMF resources has become more unpredictable because of the increased role of capital flows in balance of payments dise- quilibria. Waivers of the Articles’ limits on access to IMF resources havebeen granted where necessary to allow access in line with operational requirements. • Quotas also determine a member’s  in a general allocation of SDRs. 30 The initial quotas of the original members of the IMF were determined at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 (Schedule A of the IMF Articles); those of subsequent members have been determined by the IMF’s Board of 28A member’s voting power is equal to 250 basic votes plus one additional vote for each SDR 100,000 in quota. Basic votes therefore help to strengthen the relative voting power of members with smaller quotas. 29While the IMF’s holdings of a member’s currency, which measure its access to IMF credit, are restricted to no more than 200 percent of quota under the Articles (Article V , Section 3 (b)(iii)), this limit—which amounts to IMF credit of 100 percent of quota—is rou- tinely waived. See the discussion of “Access Policy” above. 30Article XVIII, Section 2 (b). FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 56Governors, based on principles consistent with those applied to existing members. The IMF has adjusted quotas within the context of five-yearly general reviews and on an ad hoc basis outside of general reviews. An 85 percent majority of voting power is needed to change quotas. The determination of the quota of a new member of the IMF is based on the principle that a member’s quota should be in the same range as the quo- tas of existing members of comparable economic size and characteristics.Operationally, this principle has been applied through the use of quota for- mulas. Since the IMF’s inception, the calculated quotas derived from the quota formulas have been used to help guide decisions regarding the sizeand distribution of members’ actual quotas. Quota formulas have evolved over time starting from the formula —contain- ing national income, official reserves, imports, export variability, and the ratio ofexports to national income —that was devised at Bretton Woods in 1944 to give support to the broad configuration of initial quotas that was being negotiated. A multiformula approach was adopted in the early 1960s, when the Bret- ton Woods formula was revised and supplemented by four other formulas containing the same basic variables but with larger weights for external trade and export variability. The Bretton Woods formula, with its relativelyhigh weight for national income, has generally favored large economies, while the additional four formulas have tended to produce higher quotas than the Bretton Woods formula for smaller, more open economies. The fiveformulas, which are listed in Box II.7, were last modified in 1982–83. General Reviews The IMF conducts general reviews of all members’ quotas normally at five year intervals.31 Such reviews allow the IMF to assess the adequacy of quo- tas in terms of members’ needs for conditional liquidity and the IMF’s abil- ity to finance those needs. A general review also allows for adjustments ofmembers’ quotas to reflect changes in their relative positions in the world economy. Of the general reviews conducted to date, only one (in 1958/59) was outside the five-year cycle.

II General Department 57BOX II.7. T HE PRESENT FIVE QUOTA FORMULAS The present five quota formulas, with the Bretton Woods formula listed first, are: CQ = (0.01 Y + 0.025 R + 0.05 P + 0.2276 VC)(1 + C/Y), CQ = (0.0065 Y + 0.0205125 R + 0.078P + 0.4052 VC)(1 + C/Y), CQ = (0.0045 Y + 0.03896768 R + 0.07 P + 0.76976 VC)(1 + C/Y), CQ = 0.005 Y + 0.042280464 R + 0.044 ( P + C) + 0.8352 VC, CQ = 0.0045 Y + 0.05281008 R + 0.039 ( P + C) + 1.0432 VC, where CQ = calculated quota; Y = GDP at current market prices for a recent year; R = twelve-month average of gold and foreign exchange reserves, including SDR holdings and reserve positions in the IMF, for a recent year; P = annual average of current payments (goods, services, income, and private transfers) for a recentfive-year period; C = annual average of current receipts (goods, services, income, and private transfers) for a recent five-yearperiod; and VC = variability of current receipts, defined as one standard deviation from the five-year moving average centeredon the third year, for a recent 13-year period. For each of the four non–Bretton Woods formulas, quota calculations are multiplied by an adjustment factor so that the sum of the calculations acrossmembers equals that derived from the Bretton Woods formula. The calcu-lated quota of a member is the higher of the Bretton Woods calculation orthe average of the lowest two of the remaining four calculations (afteradjustment). FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 58members. Four reviews concluded that no increase in quotas was needed. In the other eight reviews, the overall quota increase ranged from 31 percent to61 percent (Tables II.3 and II.4). Increases in members’ quotas during general reviews typically consist of two elements: (1) an equiproportional element which is distributed to all members according to their existing quota s; and (2) a selective ele- ment which is distributed to either all members or a subset of members. Theselective element is used to attain a change in quota s among members.For any overall increase in quotas, the larger the selective increase, thegreater the redistribution of quota s. In practice, the selective compo-nent has tended to be relatively small. Both the list of members eligible for a selective increase and the way of dis- tributing the selective element are based on the Executive Board’s judgment. The distribution of selective quota increases have generally been based oncalculated quotas. 32 Calculated quotas are determined by the quota formulas, which have been designed to provide a quantified measure of a country’s rela-tive economic position. 33 The following examples illustrate the methods used. • During the Sixth Review in 1976, the Executive Board decided to dou- ble the quota  of the major oil exporters with the stipulation thatthe collective  of all the developing  should not fall. Thedecision was based on the judgment that such a reallocation wouldstrengthen the IMF’s liquidity. In this instance, the quota formulasplayed no role in identifying the members eligible for the selective increase. • Under the Eleventh Review in 1998, 25 percent of the quota increase was selective. The quota formulas helped determine each member’s of the selective increase as follows: (1) 15 percent of the totalincrease (three-fifths of the selective element) was distributed to allmembers; (2) in addition, 10 percent of the total increase was distributed 32Since the Eighth Review in 1982/83, all members have received an increase comprised of an equiproportional element and a selective element that reflected a member’s  incalculated quotas. 33As further explained below, formulas are one element in determining actual quotas. While quota formulas are not mentioned in the Articles, and the Executive Board has not formally adopted any formula, the Board has usually relied on them as an independent measure ofmembers’ relative economic position in the world economy. Typically, the quota resulting from the formulas—the calculated quota—is different from the actual quota of a member and, in the most recent review, actual quotas were on average less than half of calculated quotas.

FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 62to those  whose ratio of calculated to actual quotas was consid- ered to be most “out of line.”34 Adjustments of quota s have tended to take place within general reviews, usually in the context of an urgent need for additional resources onthe part of the IMF. This reflects the fact that it has been easier to reach agreement if all members receive an increase in quotas. Agreement is more difficult to reach when only a subset of members receives an increase, as thequotas of all other members would remain unchanged and their quotas would decline. Ad Hoc Increases A member can request an adjustment of its quota at any time.35 Ad hoc quota increases can occur both within and outside the context of a general review. In recent years, they have tended to occur within a general review. As with selective increases, both the quota formulas and the ExecutiveBoard’s judgment have played a role in determining the amount of the adhoc adjustment. The following are examples. • Five members (France, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Paraguay, and the Philippines) received ad hoc increases between 1947 and 1959. The main factor underlying these increases was the view that the initialquotas of these members at the time of the Bretton Woods conference in1945 had been set at unduly low levels. Between 1959 and 1969, the quo- tas of another nine  were adjusted on an ad hoc basis. All of the foregoing increases occurred outside the context of a general review. • Japan received an ad hoc increase under the Ninth Review. In this case, the seven largest industrial  agreed to redistribute quotaincreases among themselves in such a manner that the quota increasesfor the rest of the membership were not affected. 36 34“Out of line” was defined as those  with ratios of calculated to actual quotas above one. Thirty-eight members met this criterion. Five of these members, whose quotaswere farthest out of line and which were able to contribute to the IMF’s liquidity over the medium term, received 1 percent of the 10 percent  going to the group of 38 members. 35Under Article III, Section 2 (a), the IMF may, “if it thinks fit, consider at any other time the adjustment of any particular quota at the request of the member concerned.” 36As a result of this redistribution to accommodate an ad hoc increase in the quota of Japan, the new quotas for Germany and Japan were equalized, as were the quotas of France and the United Kingdom (ranked just below those of Japan and Germany), and adjustments were made to the quotas of the United States, Canada, and Italy so that thetotal quotas for the seven  as a group was maintained unchanged. II General Department 63Since 1970, there have been only four ad hoc increases in quotas outside the framework of a general review. Ad hoc increases in the quotas of China in 1980 and of Cambodia in 1994 were associated with the change in repre- sentation of the member in the IMF (China) and the resumption of activerelations with the IMF (Cambodia), as China’s initial quota had never been increased and Cambodia’s quota had not been increased since 1970. SaudiArabia received an ad hoc increase in 1981. A major factor underlying SaudiArabia’s ad hoc increase was the desire to strengthen the IMF’s liquidity position during the developing country debt crisis before the Eighth Review had been completed. China also received an ad hoc quota increase in 2001 tobetter reflect its position in the world economy following its resumption ofexercising sovereignty over Hong Kong. For each of the post-1969 cases, thequota formulas played a role in determining the extent of the ad hocincrease. Role of the Quota Formulas In practice, the role of the quota formulas in determining actual quotas and quota  adjustments has been quite limited. As noted above, quota increases in the context of general reviews have been distributed largely onthe basis of a uniform proportionate increase in actual quotas. The continu-ing significant difference between actual and calculated quota sreflects: • the Executive Board’s view that general quota reviews should provide all members with an adequate increase in quota; • a general reluctance to make politically difficult quota  adjust- ments; and • widespread dissatisfaction with formulas that were viewed as overly complex, lacking in transparency, and not representative of actual con-ditions in the world economy. In 1999, the IMF established an external panel of independent experts, the Quota Formula Review Group (QFRG), to assess the adequacy of the for- mulas used to guide the determination of quotas and to make recommenda-tions for reforms that would take account of changes in the world economyand the international financial system and the increasing globalization ofmarkets. The eight member panel, chaired by Professor Richard Cooper ofHarvard University, submitted a report that was considered by the Executive FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 64Board, along with a staff commentary, in August 2000. The report and staff commentary were subsequently published on the IMF’s website.37 The QFRG report provided information about the history and operation of the quota formulas, suggested guiding principles for future reforms, and presented recommendations to simplify and update the formulas. The Exec- utive Board discussion revealed a wide range of views on the issues raised inthe report and the staff commentary. There was general recognition of theneed to simplify the present formulas and to update them to take account of the growing role of capital flows. However, concern was expressed that a preliminary partial quantification of the formula recommended by the panelpointed toward a greater concentration of quotas among the largest indus- trial  (subsequently confirmed by more complete and updated staff calculations). 38 Executive Directors agreed on the need to carry forward the work of the external panel with a view to developing quota formulas thatmore fully reflect members’ roles in the world economy. The International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) supported this view at their meeting in Prague in September 2001, and a work program has beenadopted to further consider alternative quota formulas prior to the 2001Annual Meetings. Reserve Tranche Positions In making the reserve asset portion of their quota payment, members acquire a liquid claim on the IMF in exchange for the reserves they provide, much like a demand deposit in a commercial bank. This claim is called thereserve tranche position; it is equal to the member’s quota less the IMF’s holdings of the member’s currency in the GRA (excluding currency holdings that stem from the member’s own use of credit). The  of a member’ssubscription maintained in reserve assets varies over time from its initiallevel of some 25 percent at the time of quota payment. A member’s reserve tranche position increases when the IMF uses its currency to lend to other members, and decreases when borrowing members use the currency to makerepayments. Reserve tranche positions are part of members’ liquid interna- tional reserves because a member may, subject only to its representation of a balance of payments need, convert its SDR-denominated reserve asset into 37See http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/quota/2000/eng/qfrg/report/index.htm and http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/quota/2000/eng/qfrg/comment/index.htm. 38See http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/quota/2001/eng/erqfq.htm. II General Department 65one or more freely usable currencies by drawing on the IMF (Box II.8). A member is obligated, if necessary, to provide an amount of reserve assets of up to 100 percent of its quota. The amount of reserve assets provided to the IMF has in practice fallen well below this maximum (Figure II.5). The IMF pays interest, called remuneration, on a member’s reserve posi- tion in the IMF, except on a small portion that is provided to the IMF as an interest-free resource. This unremunerated (non-interest-bearing) portion of the reserve tranche position is equal to 25 percent of the member’s quota on April 1, 1978 —that part of the quota that was paid in gold prior to the Second Amendment of the IMF’s Articles. The gold tranche was never remunerated historically, so it was natural to set aside this same amount in terms of SDRs on this date as the unremunerated reserve tranche. For a member that joined the IMF after that date, the unremunerated reserve tranche is the same percentage of its initial quota as the average unremuner- ated reserve tranche was as a percentage of the quotas of all other members when the new member joined the IMF . The unremunerated reserve tranche remains fixed for each member in nominal terms, but because of subsequent quota increases, it is now significantly lower when expressed as a percentage of quota.39 The average is equal to 3.8 percent, but the actual percentage is different for each member. Precautionary Balances The IMF’s resources in the GRA increase through additions to its precau- tionary balances, which comprise reserves and balances that have been set aside in the first Special Contingent Account (SCA-1). The level and rate of accumulation of precautionary balances reflect the IMF’s assessment of therisk of future operational deficits and general credit risk, including that aris- 39In the past, the proportion of the reserve tranche that was remunerated was sometimes related to the concept of the “norm” for remuneration, which was calculated as the total of (1) 75 percent of a member’s quota before the Second Amendment, plus (2) any subse- quent increases in quota. For a country that became a member after April 1, 1978, the norm is a percentage of its quota equal to the weighted average relative to quota of the norms applicable to all other members on the date that the member joined the IMF, plus the amounts of any increases in its quota afterward. At each quota increase, a member’snorm rises, becoming closer to 100 percent of its quota. The remunerated reserve tranche excludes certain holdings: all currency holdings acquired when the member used IMF resources, and currency holdings in the IMF No. 2 Account that are less than 1⁄10 of 1 per- cent of the member’s quota. See the section on “IMF Accounts in Member .” FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 66ing from overdue obligations and the risk that debtor members in good standing might at some point fall into arrears. This latter risk increases withthe level and concentration of outstanding credit, but is contained by thepositive economic effects of members’ adjustment policies and the IMF’s preferred creditor status. Reserves also provide a small amount of liquidity in the GRA. The level and composition of the precautionary balances in theGRA in recent years are shown in Table II.5. Reserves reflect accumulated net income and comprise the Special Reserve and the General Reserve. Resources in the Special Reserve may be used for any purpose for which resources in the General Reserve may be used, except distribution. • The Special Reserve was established in 1957, initially with the proceeds from a gold investment program, to provide safeguards against opera-tional deficits that were subsequently charged against this reserve. Additions to the Special Reserve have since been financed from net income, other than income derived from the SRF. • The General Reserve was established in 1958 to meet capital losses or administrative deficits. From FY1998, SRF net income has been placedBOX II.8. R ESERVE TRANCHE POLICIES The reserve tranche can be considered as the “facility of first resort.” It stands apart from the credit tranches and the various facilities in that a mem- ber’s reserve tranche position is part of its own foreign exchange reserves. Pur- chases in the reserve tranche do not therefore constitute use of IMF credit. Topreserve this character as a reserve asset available at the discretion of themember, the IMF has adopted reserve tranche policies: • The definition of the reserve tranche (quota less holdings of the member’s currency) explicitly excludes currency holdings arising from past use of IMFcredit. This is intended to enable members to make purchases in the credit tranches without having first to use their reserve tranche. The member can choose which resources to use first. • Purchases in the reserve tranche are subject to a representation by the member of a balance of payments need, as with any use of IMF resources, but the member’s representation of need cannot be challenged by the IMF. • Reserve tranche purchases are not subj ect to conditi onalit y , charges , or repurchase expectations and obligations.

Any distribution of the General Reserve must be made to all members in proportion to their quotas. Special Contingent Accounts (SCAs) are established and balances accu- mulated as part of the IMF’s overall strategy to protect itself against the neg- ative financial impact of protracted arrears, that is, obligations that have remained overdue for at least six months.40 The SCA-1 was established in 1987 as a safeguard against potential losses resulting from an ultimate failure of members in protracted arrears to settle their financial obligations to the IMF. After an initial placement of SDR 26.5 million of excess income in thatyear, annual additions to the SCA-1 have been generated through “burden- 40The IMF also levies special charges on repurchases and charges overdue for less than six months.

These allocations have amounted to 5 percent of GRA reserves at the beginning of the year up until FY2001, when the allocation was reduced to 3.3 percent. Balances in the SCA-1 are refundable to the contrib-uting debtor and creditor member  when all overdue obligations have been settled, or earlier if the IMF so decides. 41 The IMF’s objective to date has been to maintain a level of total precau- tionary balances at least equal to credit to members in protracted arrears, agoal that was first achieved in FY1993, and which has since been maintained. 41A second Special Contingent Account (SCA-2) was established as a safeguard against possible losses arising from purchases made through the encashment of rights accumulated under a rights accumulation program (RAP), and to provide additional liquidity for the financing of those encashments (see Box II.9 and Chapter V). SCA-2 was terminated in1999. II General Department 69In addition, to protect itself against general credit risk, the IMF has estab- lished a target for precautionary balances in excess of overdue credit. Thetarget range for these “free reserves” is 3–5 percent of the amount of out-standing “credit in good standing.” Free reserves had risen to 8.0 percent of credit in good standing at end-April 2001 (see Table II.5).BOX II.9. T HE BURDEN -SHARING MECHANISM Since 1986, the burden-sharing mechanism has made up for the loss of income from unpaid charges and has been used to accumulate resources in twoSpecial Contingent Accounts (SCAs). The mechanism works by providing foradditions and deductions to the rates of charge and remuneration, respectively. Resources collected from individual members under the mechanism are refundable to them as arrears cases are resolved, or as may be decided by theIMF. Thus, resources collected for unpaid charges are refunded when thesecharges are eventually settled. At end-April 2001, cumulative deferred chargesthat were subject to burden sharing amounted to SDR 1,796 million and settle-ments of unpaid charges of SDR 993 million had been made and refunded. Of the two Special Contingent Accounts, the first, SCA-1, was established specifically to protect against the financial impact of arrears in general. Thesecond, SCA-2, collected resources (1) to finance the encashment of “rights”earned by eligible members in arrears to later draw on IMF resources, and(2) to safeguard against the risk of loss arising from purchases made in connec-tion with the encashment of rights. SCA-2 was terminated in 1999, and the bal-ances in the account refunded, after it was concluded that other precautionarybalances in the GRA provided adequate protection against the risks associ-ated with rights-related credit. The termination of SCA-2 was also part of anoverall agreement on the financing of the PRGF (then ESAF) and HIPC initi-atives, for which it was envisaged that some members would voluntarily con-tribute resources refunded from SCA-2. In the aggregate, creditor and debtor members have contributed equal amounts for unpaid charges and for allocations to the SCA-1, whereas credi-tors provided three-fourths of the amounts contributed to the SCA-2. A totalof SDR 1.2 billion had been accumulated in the SCA-1 at end-April 2001. Atotal of SDR 1 billion was accumulated during the operation of the SCA-2in 1990–97. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 70Income and Expenses The amount added to reserves each year is the net income resulting from the difference between operational income and operational and administra- tive expenses. Virtually all of the IMF’s operational income is derived from the charges (interest on loans) that are levied on the outstanding use of credit in the GRA. In addition to the basic rate of charge (i.e., the rate of charge before burden sharing), the use of IMF credit under certain circumstances is subjectto surcharges, and all IMF credit is subject to service charges, commitment fees on credit lines, and special charges (see Table II.2). 42 A small amount of income is also generated by receipts of interest on the IMF’s SDR holdings(as explained in Chapter III). Operational expenses consist of the remuneration (interest) paid on remunerated reserve tranche positions, the allocation to the SCA-1, and thepayment of interest on outstanding IMF borrowing, if any. Net operational income (operational income less operational expenses) is used to cover the IMF’s administrative expenses, and the remainder constitutes net income(Table II.6). 43 Operational Income The IMF aims to achieve a target level of net income each financial year to add to its reserves.44 Based on the net income target, the SDR interest rate, projected credit, and the outlook for administrative expenses, the IMF estimates the basic rate of charge that is necessary to achieve the income tar-get. 45 The basic rate is set for the year as a proportion of the SDR interest rate. For FY2001, this proportion was set at 115.9 percent. 42The IMF also has access to a relatively small amount of interest-free resources, includ- ing its precautionary balances and the unremunerated portion of reserve tranche positions of members. 43The Income Statement of the General Department also includes the income of the SDA, which is discussed later in this chapter. 44The annual increase in reserves was set as 3 percent of reserves in the GRA at the beginning of the year for financial years 1981–84, 5 percent for financial years 1985–99, 3.9 percent for financial year 2000, and 1.7 percent for financial years 2001–02. These figures exclude income from surcharges. 45The procedure setting the basic rate of charge is governed by Rule I-6(4). II General Department 71TABLE II.6.

A separate midyear review is undertaken to establish whether an adjust- ment to the basic rate of charge is required in view of developments during the year. At the end of the financial year, if net income exceeds the amount pro- jected at the beginning of the year, the Executive Board has, in recent years, decided to reduce the rate of charge retroactively. Alternatively, the Boardcan decide to: • place all or part of any excess to reserves; or • make a distribution of excess income to members; or• take the excess into account to lower the net income target for the sub- sequent financial year. When net income falls short of the target, the Executive Board has gener- ally decided to increase the rate of charge in the subsequent financial year to make up for the shortfall. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 72Operational Expenses The IMF pays remuneration (interest) on members’ reserve tranche posi- tions equal to the SDR interest rate, except on a small portion, as indicatedearlier (see section on “Reserve Tranche Positions”). 46 Remuneration pay- ments account for almost all of IMF operational expenses when there is no outstanding IMF borrowing. If borrowing is outstanding, the IMF also paysinterest on it. The interest rate on borrowing under the General Arrange- ments to Borrow (GAB) is equal to the SDR interest rate, while under the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), it may be equal to or higher than theSDR interest rate, as explained below under “Borrowing.” Administrative Expenses The IMF’s administrative expenses can be divided into personnel, travel, building occupancy, and other such costs. Personnel and travel-related out- lays typically account for about 80 percent of total administrative expenses.The GRA is reimbursed for the cost of administering the SDR Department through an assessment levied in proportion to each participant’s allocation of SDRs. The GRA is also to be reimbursed for the expenses incurred inadministering the PRGF Trust. However, following the establishment of the SRF and the consequent increase in net income, this reimbursement has been forgone and the amount that would otherwise have been reimbursedhas been transferred to the PRGF-HIPC Trust. This arrangement has been in place since 1998 and is expected to continue up to 2004. Borrowing The IMF can borrow to supplement its quota resources. It maintains two standing borrowing arrangements with official lenders and can borrow from private markets, although it has not done so to date. Borrowing has playedan important role in providing temporary, supplemental resources to the IMF at critical junctures in the past (Table II.7). In recent years, the borrow- ing arrangements with official lenders have been enlarged and their partici-pation broadened, strengthening IMF liquidity. 46/G01The basic (unadjusted) rate of remuneration has been equal to the SDR interest rate since February 1, 1987. However, refundable adjustments to that rate are made under “burden sharing.” The Articles require that the rate of remuneration be maintained in the range of 80–100 percent of the SDR interest rate. The current relationship between therate of remuneration and the SDR interest rate is governed by Rule I-10. II General Department 73TABLE II.7.

The GAB were originally conceived as arrangements whereby the main industrial(Group of Ten)  agreed to stand ready to lend the IMF up to speci-fied amounts of their currencies, thereby strengthening its financial position.These loans would be made when supplementary resources were needed bythe IMF to help finance drawings by GAB participants in a setting where such financing would forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system. Because the industrial  have the largest quotasand may, when they need to, claim a large proportion of the IMF’s usableresources, the GAB provide strong support for the IMF’s financial soundnessand for ensuring that resources available to other  are not reduced. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 74The GAB enable the IMF to borrow specified amounts of currencies from 11 industrial  or their central banks, under certain circumstances, at market-related rates of interest (Table II.8). The potential amount of creditavailable to the IMF under the GAB is SDR 17 billion, with an additional SDR 1.5 billion available under an associated agreement with Saudi Arabia. The GAB are reviewed and renewed regularly. A broad review of the GAB was undertaken in 1983, at the outset of the developing country debtcrisis. The most important changes to emerge from that review were the sub- stantial enlargement of the GAB to its present size (from about SDR 6 bil- lion), the addition of SDR 1.5 billion under the associated agreement withSaudi Arabia, and the change to permit use of the GAB to finance IMF lending to nonparticipants in the GAB if the IMF faces an inadequacy of r e s o u r c e s . S i n c e 1 9 8 3 , t h e G A B a n d t h e a s s o c i a t e d a g r e e me n t w i t h S a u d iArabia have been renewed every four or five years without further modifi- cation, most recently for a further five-year period from December 26, 1998. The GAB have been activated ten times. The GAB were last activated in July 1998 for an amount of SDR 6.3 billion (SDR 1.4 billion of which was drawn) in connection with the financing of an Extended Arrangement forRussia. The activation for Russia was canceled in March 1999, when the IMF repaid the outstanding amount following the coming into effect of the Elev- enth General Review of Quotas and payment of the bulk of the quotaincreases. Prior to the activation for Russia, the most recent activation occurred in 1977, when the IMF borrowed for lending to the United Kingdom and Italy under Stand-By Arrangements, and in 1978 to finance a reservetranche purchase by the United States. A proposal for calls on the GAB by the IMF’s Managing Director can become effective only if it is accepted by the GAB participants, and the proposal is then approved by the Executive Board. The IMF also has New Arrangements to Borrow to deal with financial cri- ses. Following the Mexican financial crisis in December 1994, concern that substantially more resources might be needed to respond to future financial crises prompted participants in the June 1995 Group of Seven Halifax Sum-mit to call on the Group of Ten and other financially strong  to develop financing arrangements that would double the amount available to the IMF under the GAB. The NAB became effective on November 17, 1998. The NAB effectively double the resources available under the GAB. The NAB are a set of credit arrangements between the IMF and 25 members and institutions to provide supplementary resources to the IMF to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to dealwith an exceptional situation to the stability of that system.

The total amount of resources available to the IMFunder the NAB and GAB combined is SDR 34 billion. The NAB can be renewed and enlarged. The NAB decision will be in effect for five years from its effective date and may be renewed, at whichtime an IMF member or institution that is not currently a participant in theNAB may be accepted as a participant, if the IMF and participants repre-senting 80 percent of the total credit arrangements agree to the request. Newparticipants may be accepted at other times by way of an amendment to theNAB adopted by a decision of the IMF’s Executive Board and with the con-currence of participants representing 85 percent of total credit arrange-ments. Commitments from participants are based on relative economicstrength, as measured by actual IMF quotas, as a predominant criterion. Activation procedures for the NAB are modeled on the GAB. The NAB have been activated once —to finance a Stand-By Arrangement for Brazil in December 1998, when the IMF called on funding of SDR 9.1 billion (SDR2.9 billion of which was used). This activation was canceled on March 11,1999, when the IMF repaid the outstanding amount following the entry intoeffect of the Eleventh General Review of Quotas and payment of the bulkof the quota increases. Past Borrowing Arrangements The IMF borrowed extensively when payments imbalances were large and persistent. Reliance on borrowing was especially heavy during the period oflarge payments imbalances between the early 1970s and the mid-1980s, whenborrowing financed 40–60 percent of IMF credit. The need for supplemental resources to meet the heavy demand for IMF resources stemmed in partfrom the relatively small increases in quotas approved in the 1970s, and theneed to bridge to the increases in quotas in 1980 and 1983. Also importantwas the skewed distribution of payments imbalances relative to the distribu-tion of quotas at the time: • large payments surpluses were concentrated in a comparatively small number of members with relatively small quotas; and • payments deficits were far more widely dispersed and were large rela- tive to the quotas of most members. The IMF has borrowed only from official sources. Borrowing has been almost exclusively from members or their monetary authorities, the excep-tions being nonmember Switzerland (now a member), the Hong Kong Mon- II General Department 77etary Authority (under the NAB), and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Borrowing from official sources has the advantage thatthese lenders are familiar with the IMF’s needs and operational features,and there is by now a substantial body of experience from which to draw.The IMF is permitted to borrow from private sources and has consideredthis option on several occasions: the prevailing view has been that resort toprivate market borrowing would change the cooperative and monetarynature of the institution in ways that would be undesirable; a number ofoperational issues would also need to be addressed, such as the use of collat-eral, managing financial risk, and the cost relative to official borrowing. Borrowing arrangements  many common characteristics: •Denomination of borrowing . The indebtedness of members to the IMF is denominated in SDRs. To avoid exchange risks, IMF borrowing has generally been denominated in SDRs or the currencies that make upthe SDR basket in proportion to their weight in that basket. •Media of payment . The IMF cannot borrow SDRs. In most bilateral bor- rowing agreements, the lender has provided U.S. dollars or its own freelyusable currency, or the lender has undertaken to convert its currency intoa freely usable currency as needed by the IMF. For repayment, the IMFhas generally sought maximum flexibility in the borrowing agreementbut lenders have on occasion insisted on repayment in the currency of their choice, usually U.S. dollars or their own currency. •Maturities . The IMF seeks to match the maturities of its assets and liabil- ities. Under the two Oil Facilities and the SFF, for example, the IMF bor- rowed when currency was needed for purchase and repaid lenders when the corresponding repurchases were made. This was not possible underthe borrowing agreements established for the Enlarged Access Policy(EAP), as some central banks were willing to lend only at the short endof the maturity spectrum (see Table II.7). The resulting mismatch ofmaturities led to the establishment of Borrowed Resources Suspense Accounts within the GRA as a means of holding and investing tempo- rarily currencies not yet needed to finance purchases under the EAP . •Liquidity and transferability . Borrowing agreements with lenders other than the BIS have consistently provided for encashability at face value upon representation of balance of payments need. These agreements further stipulate that the IMF would give such a representation theoverwhelming benefit of the doubt. A member’s lending to the IMF istherefore regarded as a liquid reserve asset and is included as part ofthe member’s international reserves. In addition, claims on the IMF are FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 78normally transferable to other official holders, which provides some protection to the IMF’s liquidity. •Interest rates. In the early years of the IMF, interest rates on IMF bor- rowing and charges on purchases financed by borrowed resources werevery low. Following the introduction of remuneration with the FirstAmendment of the Articles of Agreement in 1969, more attention waspaid to the rate of return on the reserves that members made available tothe IMF. Market rates were increasingly seen by members as the oppor-tunity cost of lending to the IMF. In line with market practice, borrowingagreements since 1977 have provided for floating interest rates. To pro-tect the IMF’s income position, the cost of borrowing plus a small marginhas been reflected in the rate of charge on the use of borrowed resources. Management of Financial Resources and the Liquidity Position for lending. The IMF’s usable resources consist of currencies of IMF mem- bers with a strong balance of payments position and SDRs, which stemmainly from quota payments. The institution maintains substantial holdingsof gold and other fixed assets, but these are not used in lending operations.Borrowing by the IMF to finance the extension of credit through the GRA isan important complement to the use of its quota resources but remains theexception rather than the rule. Borrowing is, however, a central feature ofIMF lending under the PRGF, as discussed in Chapter IV . The usability of the IMF’s currency holdings varies over time. In principle, the currencies of all members are available for use in IMF transactions.Members have an obligation to convert balances of their currency purchasedfrom the IMF by other members into one of the four freely usable curren- 47 position to meet this currency exchange obligation when drawing up itsquarterly financial transactions plan (see below). The currencies of these 47Article V, Section 3 (e)(i).As noted above, not all of the IMF’s resources are immediately available cies: the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the pound sterling. The IMF determines which members are in a sufficiently strong external II General Department 79members are considered to be usable in IMF transactions for the duration of that quarter, while all other currencies are considered unusable. The IMF’s holdings of SDRs are a readily usable resource, but these hold- ings account for only a small fraction of the IMF’s assets. The use of SDRs held by the IMF is therefore not limited to the same extent as the use of itscurrency holdings. The IMF periodically establishes a long-term target range for the level of its SDR holdings, which guides the actual use of SDRs in IMF transactions. Other factors affecting the level of the IMF’s holdings ofSDRs are discussed in Chapter III. The IMF closely monitors its liquidity position. Table II.9 presents the IMF’s financial resources and liquidity position as of April 30, 2001. 48 F or this purpose, the stock of usable resources is adjusted downward to take intoaccount amounts already committed to members under existing IMF arrangements. A further downward adjustment is made to ensure that the IMF retains at all times sufficient working balances of each of the currenciesof members included in the financial transactions plan. The resulting amount of net uncommitted usable resources is in principle available to meet new demand for IMF resources. In practice, however, the adequacy of the IMF’s liquidity position must also take into account the existence of liq- uid claims accumulated by its creditor members: reserve tranche positionsand any outstanding loans under the GAB and NAB. These are considered liquid liabilities because they can be drawn at short notice in the event of balance of payments need, akin to demand deposits in a commercial bank,and are thus the first claim on IMF resources. The liquidity ratio ties these two concepts together in a single measure of the IMF’s liquidity. Historically, the liquidity ratio has never fallen below 25–30 percent. Financial Transactions Plan The IMF manages its usable resources through a financial transactions plan. This is the mechanism through which the IMF selects the memberswhose currencies are to be used in IMF transactions and allocates thefinancing of those transactions among members included in the plan. Bothcurrencies and SDRs are included in the financial transactions plan fortransfers (credits) from the IMF to borrowing members but only currencies 48The IMF’s “Financial Resources and Liquidity Position” is posted monthly on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/liquid).

The total amount for transfers in the trans- actions plan is based on the expected volume of credit to be extended tomembers and operational payments by the IMF (such as interest on official borrowing by the IMF) during the plan period. Receipts in currencies are estimated on the basis of the schedule of forthcoming repayments and thepreferences of members with respect to the media of payment (i.e., curren- cies versus SDRs). II General Department 81Currency selection is based on judgments about the external positions of members. The currencies of members are selected for inclusion in the finan- cial transactions plan based on a finding by the IMF that the member’s bal- ance of payments and reserve position is sufficiently strong. Specific indicators of external strength are used to maintain a reasonable degree of consistency among members, but the assessment of a member’s combined balance of pay-ments and reserve position is ultimately a matter of judgment. It has not therefore been considered desirable to rely on automatic indicators or to define rigidly the notion of a sufficiently strong external position; the circum-stances of members, including their need to hold reserves, differ considerably. All relevant factors and data are considered in this assessment. Particular emphasis is placed on recent and prospective current account balances, external competitiveness, and external debt indicators, especially those offering insights into the member’s exposure to short-term liquidity strains.Members may be included in the financial transactions plan even though there may be some elements of weakness in their overall balance of pay- ments and reserve position. Two broader considerations underlying the financial structure of the IMF have guided the staff and the Executive Board in coming to conclusionsabout a member’s external strength for the purpose of participation in the financial transactions plan. • First, the IMF draws on a wide range of members —large and small, advanced, developing, and transition —for its financial activities, reflect- ing first and foremost the cooperative nature of the institution. Broad participation of members in the financial transactions plan also works to maximize the liquidity of the GRA. • Second, the use of a member’s currency in the financial transactions plan generally entails a change in the composition of the member’s interna- tional reserves. For most of these members, IMF transactions involve a reduction (increase) in their foreign exchange holdings, which is fullyoffset by an increase (decrease) in their reserve tranche position in theIMF . This creditor position is included as part of the member’s interna- tional reserves as it is a liquid claim on foreign exchange resources that can be drawn on demand in the event of balance of payments need. Decisions on the selection of currencies are taken by the Executive Board. The staff proposes a list of members it considers sufficiently strongeach quarter, and the Executive Board takes a decision based on this list. It FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 82is open to an Executive Director to request the exclusion or inclusion of any member, but the decision rests with the Executive Board as a whole. Amember’s consent to its inclusion is not required, although its views on itsbalance of payments and reserve position are taken into account by theExecutive Board before a decision is taken. The outcome of the financial transactions plan is published on the IMF’s website. 49 Currency allocation aims to maintain broadly even participation among members. The allocation of transfers and receipts among members in thefinancial transactions plan is based on guidelines established by the ExecutiveBoard. 50 The currencies of all members included in the financial transactions plan are allocated for transfers in direct proportion to their quotas. Receipts are allocated to members’ currencies included in the plan so as to ensure that the creditor positions of members included in the plan remain broadly bal-anced over time in relation to quota. The net impact of both transfers andreceipts on reserve tranche positions is illustrated in Figure II.6. If a currency included in the financial transactions plan is not one of the currencies that the IMF has determined to be freely usable in the principal foreign exchange markets, the issuing member is required, if requested by a purchasing member at the time of the purchase, to exchange the amount ofits currency sold by the IMF for a freely usable currency (in most cases, theU.S. dollar) at the representative exchange rate as advised by the IMF. Pro-cedures have also been established for the exchange of each freely usablecurrency into other freely usable currencies. Similar procedures apply to exchanges of currencies related to repurchases. Special Disbursement Account The SDA was initially activated to receive transfers from the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund had been funded largely from the sale of gold and upon itstermination in 1981, all Trust Fund loan repayments were transferred to theSDA. Loans were provided from the SDA under the Structural AdjustmentFacility (SAF), which was established in March 1986 to provide balance of 49The “Quarterly Report on Financing IMF Transactions” is posted one quarter after the end of the period on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/ftp). 50See S elected Decisions and Documents of the International Monetary Fund (Washing- ton: IMF, Twenty-Fifth Issue, June 30, 2000), pp. 260–65.

The assets of the SDA now consist of the remaining loan balances out- standing under the SAF and investments in marketable fixed-income securi-ties. These assets originate from the transfers received from the Trust Fundand the profits from the sale of a portion of the IMF’s gold in financial year2000. The net income from the investment of gold profits has been autho-rized for transfers, on an as-needed basis in accordance with the decisions ofthe IMF, to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility–Heavily IndebtedPoor  Trust (PRGF-HIPC Trust). Chapter IV discusses the financing and conduct of concessional lending by the IMF, including the investment of SDA resources. IMF Accounts in Member  The IMF conducts its financial dealings with a member through the fiscal agency and the depository designated by the member. The fiscal agency may be the member’s treasury (ministry of finance), central bank, official mone-tary agency, stabilization fund, or other similar agency. The IMF can only deal with, or through, the designated fiscal agency, which is authorized to carry out transactions with the IMF on behalf of the member country. Inaddition, each member is required to designate its central bank as a deposi- tory for the IMF’s holdings of the member’s currency, or if it has no central bank, a monetary agency or a commercial bank acceptable to the IMF. Mostmembers of the IMF have designated their central bank as both the deposi- tory and the fiscal agency. The depository is required to pay out of the IMF’s holdings of the member’s currency, on demand and without delay, sums toany payee named by the IMF in the member’s own territory, and to hold securities on behalf of the IMF should the member decide to issue nonnego- tiable, non-interest-bearing notes, or similar instruments, in substitution forpart of the IMF’s currency holdings. Each member guarantees all assets of the IMF against loss resulting from failure or default on the part of the 51Interest on SAF loans is charged at ½ of 1 percent a year. II General Department 85depository. Thus, the IMF’s pool of currencies and reserve assets in the GRA are not held at the IMF, but in depositories in the member . The depository maintains, without any service charge or commission, two accounts that are used to record the IMF’s holdings of the member’s currency: the IMF No. 1 Account and the IMF No. 2 Account. The No. 1 Account isused for IMF transactions, including subscription payments, purchases and repurchases (i.e., use and repayment of GRA resources), and repayment of resources borrowed by the IMF. Payment of charges on the use of IMF creditand the IMF’s payment of interest on reserve tranche positions are conducted in SDRs and therefore not recorded in these accounts. Provided that a mini- mum is maintained in the No. 1 Account, as explained below, all these transac-tions can alternatively be carried out through the IMF Securities Account. A member may establish an IMF Securities Account in order to substitute parts of the holdings in the IMF No. 1 Account with nonnegotiable, non-inter-est-bearing notes, or similar instruments payable to the IMF on demand when the currency is needed for the IMF’s transactions. The depository holds these notes for safekeeping and acts as the agent of the IMF to obtain encashmentof the notes in order to maintain, at all times, the minimum required balance in the No. 1 Account. 52 The No. 2 Account is used for the IMF’s administrative expenditures and receipts (for example, from sales of IMF ) in the member’s cur-rency and within its territory. The balances in both the No. 1 and No. 2Accounts that originate from the payment of the local currency portion ofquota subscriptions do not yield any interest for the IMF. The currency por-tion of the d capital, while fully paid, is held in non-interest-bearingform and generates no income for the IMF until used and converted intoclaims on members in the form of use of IMF credit. Disclosure of Financial Position with the IMF in the Member Country53 When a member has designated the central bank as both depository and fiscal agent, the central bank should present the full financial position of the 52If any payment by the IMF reduces the balance in the No. 1 Account below a mini- mum of ¼ of 1 percent of the member’s quota, the balance is to be restored to that level by the next business day through the encashment of sufficient notes. 53This discussion presents IMF member positions in the General and SDR Departments. FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF 86member with the IMF in its balance sheet.54 A central bank may choose to indicate this on either a gross or net basis. The position in the GeneralDepartment is presented on a gross basis if the IMF No. 1, No. 2, and Securi-ties Accounts are shown as liabilities and the member’s quota is shown as anasset. Membership in the SDR Department would be indicated by showingSDR holdings as an asset and the cumulative SDR allocation as a liability. Members may also choose to reflect their financial position on a net basis. A member who has a net reserve tranche position in the IMF and is notusing IMF credit would present the net reserve tranche position as anasset. 55 Members with a net reserve tranche position who are also using credit in the GRA would disclose the reserve tranche as an asset and cur-rency holdings stemming from the use of IMF credit as a liability, since theIMF is not entitled to demand settlement or offset a member’s use of credit from its reserve tranche position. The members’ position in the SDRDepartment may also be shown on a net basis. The presentation of IMF-related assets and liabilities should be further elaborated in the explanatorynotes to the financial statements and, as a minimum, provide informationnot available in the balance sheet regarding the member’s quota, the compo- sition of the IMF’s currency holdings, and the maturity structure of IMFcredit, if any. In cases where the central bank acts as depository and the ministry of finance, treasury, or a similar agency is the fiscal agent, it is recommendedthat the central bank record all IMF-related assets and liabilities and offsetthese against government accounts. 56 While practices may differ depending on the relationship between the central bank and the agency acting as fiscalagent, this approach ensures public disclosure of the member’s financialrelationship with the IMF, since government agencies typically do not pre- 54For this reason it is also recommended to include the Securities Account in the IMF position, even though the actual securities may be issued by the government. The IMF con- siders securities issued in lieu of currency deposits to the IMF No. 1 Account equivalent to currency holdings because they are encashable on demand. Exclusion of the Securities Account would therefore misrepresent the member’s overall IMF position. 55A member has a net reserve tranche position when its quota exceeds the IMF’s hold- ings of its currencies, excluding currencies stemming from the use of IMF credit and hold- ings in the No. 2 Account that are less than 1⁄10 of 1 percent of quota. 56Of the IMF’s 183 member , only 41 have not designated their central bank as the fiscal agent. II General Department 87pare financial statements.57 Consolidating the IMF position in the balance sheet of the central bank also allows for a simple reconciliation between for-eign reserves data monitored under an IMF-supported program or pub-lished by a member and the balance sheet of the central bank. Since mostcentral banks are subject to an annual audit, full inclusion of the IMF posi-tion provides additional assurance about the accuracy and availability of for-eign reserves. Appendix IV illustrates how IMF membership could be presented on either a gross or net basis in the balance sheet of a central bank that acts asboth fiscal agent and depository for the member with the IMF. 57PRGF transactions would also be shown in the balance sheet of the central bank if the central bank were the recipient of the proceeds of PRGF disbursements."

A summary of the results of the annual pay gap analysis (PGA), conducted in FY 2021, which for the /f_i rst time included a race component, is available in Annex 1. Sta/uniFB00 Composition: The composition of IMF employees by gender, career stream, region, and education has not signiﬁ cantly changed since the 2019 D&I Report, although the IMF has seen an increase in the  of contractual employees in the last two years. Status against the FY 2025 Benchmarks : The  of sta/uniFB00 members at the indi- vidual contributor level (A9–A14/A15) has exceeded the benchmarks for nationals from East Asia (15.2 percent vs. 15 percent target) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (9.2 percent vs. 8 percent target), but the IMF continues to struggle to meet the benchmark for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA+) region (5.7 percent vs 8 percent target). At the managerial level, the new benchmark framework increased the targets for representation of both women and those from underrepresented regions (URRs). As such, at the end of FY 2021, attainment of managerial bench-marks is considerably lagging across the board, although sustained progress has been seen in the  of women in these roles, and there is su/uniFB03 cient time to meet the targets. Recruitment: The IMF leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions by pivoting to virtual sourcing and talent attraction, increasing the number of recruit- ment missions by 300 percent. Hiring trends show an improvement in the  of MENA+ nationals recruited, particularly in FY 2021, but progress remains slow. Promotions: The report covers promotions from professional to managerial roles and from administrative to professional levels. The trend of higher rates of promo- tion for women continues/uni003B however, there are considerable di/uniFB00 erences in the rates of promotion between women from URRs and women from Other Regions (all regions combined, except for URRs).Separations: The current separation rate is about 5 percent, with most sepa- rations due to retirements. The number of voluntary resignations has steadily decreased since 2017. Over the last ﬁ ve years, nationals of the MENA+ region had a higher rate of voluntary resignations than those from the other two URRs as well as a slightly higher rate than the IMF average of 1.5 percent. Inclusion : Several important initiatives were launched in the last two years to foster a more inclusive work environment in which the IMF’s diverse sta/uniFB00 can thrive. Racial equity and justice are now squarely on the IMF’s agenda, and URR nationals are participating in a pilot Sponsorship Program. The IMF has started to look at its policies and practices as they relate to people who identify as having a disability, and the mandatory D&I training has been updated. Holding Managers Accountable: As indicated in the 2019 Report, managerial accountability for achieving D&I results needs to be strengthened. To this end, the IMF implemented departmental action plans in FY 2021 and is updating the Accountability Framework to reﬂ ect the FY 2025 benchmarks and key indicators included in the departmental action plans. A D&I Survey was launched in March 2021 to gauge sta/uniFB00 perceptions around, among others, belonging, inclusion, discrimination, and harassment. Two-Year Framework : Over the next two years, the focus will be on leveraging the approved headcount increase and higher number of retirements to improve the diversity of the IMF’s sta/uniFB00 . In addition, the Fund will systematically monitor rates of promotion, implement actions to ensure equitable opportunities for career development, and continue to improve its accountability mechanisms. 2020–2021 Report 1 Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) continue to be business priorities for the IMF, with the full support of the IMF’s Management. D&I eﬀ orts are based on the need to ensure a level playing /f_i eld and equitable treatment for all staﬀ in terms of recruitment, career development, and growth opportunities. Since the last D&I Report in 2019, the Managing Director has reasserted the IMF’s commitment to D&I by issuing an updated Diversity & Inclusion statement,1 endorsing the FY 2025 Benchmarks framework and targets, and approving the inclusion of an expanded nondiscrimination clause in the high-level principles governing the employment policies and practices in the IMF’s Sta/uniFB00 Handbook. The last IMF D&I Report proposed a signiﬁ cant number of actions to achieve progress against objectives. The 2019 D&I Report proposed a total of 46 actions, covering a range of initiatives related to recruitment, career management, and accountability. In addition, the 2025 D&I Benchmarks Working Group proposed 35 initiatives to increase the likelihood of achieving the FY 2025 Benchmarks. As the actions and initiatives were designed to span a period of one to ﬁ ve years, there was no assumption that all would be started or implemented by the date of this report, and many are meant to be ongoing. As a preamble to this 2020–21 D&I Report, it is worth taking stock of the progress made in the implementation of the actions to date. Table 1 provides a numerical summary of the proposed initiatives and the progress toward their implementa-tion. Of the 81 actions, 9 (11 percent) have been completed, and 34 (42 percent) are underway. The IMF will progressively implement most of the remainder over the next three years and will consider three of the recommendations on a longer-term horizon. This 2020–21 D&I Report presents an overview of the IMF’s accomplishments as well as its remaining challenges. 1 Diversity & Inclusion statement - https://www.imf.org/external/hrd/diversity.htmTable 1.

As an international organization, the IMF has a duty to reﬂ ect its membership in the composition of its sta/uniFB00 . 2 Looking at the overall population, women account for 47 percent of total employees (the same as in the previous report) but only 31 percent of economists (a 0.8 percent increase since end FY 2019). Nationals from underrepresented regions (URRs) 3 represent 27 percent of sta/uniFB00 . Interestingly, women are more represented among URR nationals than in Other Regions.4 2 Article XII reads in part: In appointing the sta/uniFB00 the Managing Director shall, subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of e/uniFB03 ciency and technical competence, pay due regard to the importance of recruiting personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible.” 3 There are three under-represented regions East Asia, Middle East and North Africa+ (MENA+), and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Annex 2 provides a list of individual  represented in each region. 4 “Other Regions” refers to all regions excluding URRs: that is, Asia (excl. East Asia), Europe (excl. Transition ), Other Western Hemisphere, Transition , and the United States & Canada. A full list of coun-tries under each regional group can be found in Annex 3, Table 9.Setting targets (referred to as “benchmarks” at the IMF) is a way of providing an impetus to increase diversity over time. The IMF ﬁ rst established benchmarks in 2003 and has revised them several times as targets were met, and further prog-ress was deemed necessary. In early FY 2021, a new benchmark framework set the IMF on a path to achieve greater progress by the end of FY 2025. Additional details on the new framework and targets can be found in the “Holding Managers Accountable” section. This section provides a high-level view of the IMF’s popula-tion by gender, URR, career stream, 5 and educational diversity, as well as detailed progress to date against the new FY 2025 Benchmarks. 5 There are two main career streams in the IMF: Economists and the Specialized Career Stream.

This section provides a high-level summary of the diversity of IMF employees, both sta/uniFB00 and contractual, 6 who represent 151 member  at the end of FY 2021. Figure 1 shows an overview of the gender distribution of employees by regional grouping, career stream, and employment type. The overall balance between women and men remains stable. Interestingly, women make up more than half of URR employees, compared to 45 percent in Other Regions. While the IMF would like to see a higher representation of women in the Economist stream, the ﬁ gures are in line with the industry (see The Economist ) 7. The  of men in the contractual employment category has risen by 2.7 percentage points to 44.8 percent in the last two years, which reﬂ ects increased hiring of contractual employees at professional levels. 6 Contractual employees with contracts of one year or more. 7 The Economist - https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2017/12/19/women-and-economics 2020–2021 Report 3 The overall distribution of sta/uniFB00 and contractual employees by gender and career stream can be found in Figure 2. The  of sta/uniFB00 versus contractual employees has dropped slightly from 82.2 percent at the end of FY 2019 to 80.8 percent at the end of FY 2021, driven by an increase in the  of contractual employees in the Economist career stream. The higher  of female contractual employees in the Specialized Career Stream reﬂ ects the concentration of assistant and administrative roles in this stream. Figure 2.

Figure 3 provides a more granular breakdown of the  of sta/uniFB00 by region and grade group and the  of sta/uniFB00 by region and gender, respectively. URR nationals represent 27 percent of the total sta/uniFB00 population—a 1 percentage point increase since the end of FY 2019, fueled primarily by higher s of sta/uniFB00 from sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. In managerial roles, however, URR nationals comprise only 17.6 percent versus a cumulative benchmark of 28 percent. Europe (excluding Transition  8) has the highest overall representation (Figure 3, panel 1). European nationals represent 24.5 percent of the sta/uniFB00 population, of which 19.2 percent (almost one in ﬁ ve) are B-level managers—accounting for 37.6 percent of all B-level managers. Similarly, while representing 7.5 percent of total sta/uniFB00 , 20 percent (one in ﬁ ve) of Asian (excluding East Asia) nationals are B-level managers. For other regions, however, the picture is quite di/uniFB00 erent: the ratio of B-level managers to sta/uniFB00 ranges from one in eight (United States & Canada and MENA+) to one in ﬁ fteen and one in twenty-two, respectively, for sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. 8 Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.Looking at gender by region, some notable di/uniFB00 erences emerge (Figure 3, panel 2). European women account for only one in three (33.5 percent) of their nationals, the lowest ratio amongst all the regional groupings. Women from sub-Saharan Africa, MENA+, Asia (excluding East Asia), and Other Western Hemisphere all represent more than 40 percent of their nationals, whereas one in two sta/uniFB00 members from East Asia, Transition , and the United States & Canada are women. When looking at the distribution by region, career stream, and gender (Figure 4, panel 1), there are some shifts compared to those reported in the 2019 Report (Figure 4, panel 2). In the Economist stream, the s of nationals from the United States & Canada, Transition , and Europe have decreased, while the s of sta/uniFB00 from the three URRs have increased. These shifts in representation can largely be attributed to increased e/uniFB00 orts to source candidates from URRs, especially through the midcareer economist process. For the Specialized Career Streams, the data reveal an increase in nationals from the United States & Canada and a coincidental decrease in the  of sta/uniFB00 from Europe (excluding Transition ).

Throughout the COVID-19 lockdown, the IMF has relied exclusively on virtual outreach and interviews, resulting in a 300 percent increase in recruitment missions. The Economist Program has seen a signiﬁ cant increase in the number of virtual outreach sessions, especially to universities within URR regions. In addition, a more proactive approach was deployed to source candidates from URRs for the mid-career process. As shown in Figure 5, some slight progress has been made—at the end of FY 2021, 3 percent of sta/uniFB00 with PhDs obtained their degrees from URR universities—up from 2 percent at the end of FY 2019 and 8 percent from universities in Other Regions—up from 7 percent. At the same time, 10 percent of sta/uniFB00 from Other Western Hemisphere and SSA have PhDs from universities in URR or Other . Outreach and sourcing activities often bear fruit only after several years. The IMF anticipates continued progress in the years ahead but will seek to maintain the momentum and continue proactive outreach to and sourcing from universities and talent pools in lesser-represented regions and . IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03 ce 6 Progress Toward FY 2025 Diversity Benchmarks The status at the end of FY 2021 against the FY 2025 benchmarks reveals progress in ﬁ ve of the eight indicators, including on A9–A14/A15 sta/uniFB00 from URRs. Despite this progress, more e/uniFB00 orts are needed, speciﬁ cally for women and MENA+ nationals at the individual contributor level and URR sta/uniFB00 at the managerial level (Table 2). There was a slight decrease in the percentage  of representation for two of the targets, although absolute numbers have increased, and there was no change for one of the benchmarks (see arrows in the last column). A ﬁ ve-year trend for the benchmarks and other regional groupings can be found in Annex 3, Table 1. A more precise capture of the IMF’s broader diversity emerges when incorpo- rating sta/uniFB00 with self-declared secondary nationalities. Including sta/uniFB00 who have self-declared a secondary nationality from one of the URRs reveals a signiﬁ cant jump in representation. More speciﬁ cally, at the individual contributor level, for the MENA+ region the di/uniFB00 erence is +1.7 percentage points (an additional 31 sta/uniFB00 members) and for sub-Saharan Africa an increase of 0.8 percentage points (14 sta/uniFB00 members), with a similar impact for managerial roles. The picture for the  of women at di/uniFB00 erent levels of the organization is mixed. Since the new benchmarks were introduced in July 2020, the overall number of women in the individual contributor grades (A9–A14/15) has increased slightly, but the percentage  has marginally decreased. The  of women in mana-gerial roles (A14/A15–B5) increased 1.6 percentage points to 34.5 percent in the last ﬁ scal year, with an even stronger performance at the most senior levels (B4 and B5). These gains reﬂ ect the continued e/uniFB00 orts by management to rebalance gender in managerial roles. Finally, the IMF continues to encourage the Executive Board to lead by example. The IMF recognizes the commitment to promote gender diversity and the e/uniFB00 orts being undertaken by the Executive Board’s Working Group on Gender Diversity to raise awareness of the beneﬁ ts and importance of gender diversity. Since the 2019 D&I Report and at the time of writing, the number of female Executive Directors has increased from three at the end of FY 2019 to four/uni003B however, women still represent only 17 percent of Executive Directors. When Alternate Executive Directors are added, the  of women is 15 percent (8 of 52) with one Executive Director vacancy. 9 9 Lundberg, Shelly, and Jena Sterns. 2019. “Women in Economics: Stalled Progress.” Journal of Economic Perspectives 33 (1): 3–22 - https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.1.3 .Figure 6.

At the individual contributor level, the  of nationals for all three underrepresented regions has increased, with the representation of East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa remaining above the target. For managerial roles, the  of nationals from sub-Saharan Africa has grown slightly, and good progress in the  of women continues. The  of women at individual contributor level, however, has decreased slightly. The  of URR nationals in managerial roles has increased slightly but is well below the target. A full picture of the diversity of the IMF’s population is critical. It is equally critical to understand the three factors that contribute to the makeup of the population: inﬂ ow (recruitment), career progression (promotion), and outﬂ ow (separation). These are addressed in the next three sections, with speciﬁ c challenges high-lighted to draw attention to where the focus should be placed in the coming three to four years to achieve the FY 2025 benchmarks.

This section sets out high-level key data related to trends in external recruitment. The IMF has encountered uneven success in its diversity recruitment, similar to trends in achieving diversity benchmarks. At the individual contributor level, the IMF has recruited su/uniFB03 cient nationals from East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to meet objectives/uni003B however, considerable struggles remain in recruiting from the MENA+ region and women into professional roles. Similarly, the low  of women and URR nationals hired into managerial roles is insu/uniFB03 cient to contribute to the achievement of the FY 2025 Benchmarks. In FY 2021, 46 percent of external hires were sta/uniFB00 , and 54 percent were contrac- tual employees. As in previous years, the vast majority (67 percent) of all hires were into the A9–A15 or equivalent Professional (P) category for contractual employees. In the Support category (S for contractuals and A1–A8 for sta/uniFB00 ), a much higher ratio of contractual employees is being hired (1 in 2 vs. 1 in 8 sta/uniFB00 ). This reﬂ ects the high number of  Assistants hired as contractual employees. Managerial roles accounted for 4 percent of all external recruitments (Figure 7)./T_h e IMF uses recruitment as its main tool to increase staﬀ diversity. While adhering to the aim of recruiting the highest-quali/f_i ed candidates, it is strategically important to consider diversity in terms of gender, regional representation, as well as educational and professional background. 2020–2021 Report 9 Trends The 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group recommended reducing the number of recruitment targets. For the period leading up to the end of FY 2025, the 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group proposed having only two external recruitment targets—one for women (50 percent) and the other for nationals from MENA+ (10 percent), both for roles in grades A9–A15 (individual contributors), so as to focus the IMF’s recruitment e/uniFB00 orts on the main challenges. Since the last report, the IMF has made some progress in increasing the  of MENA+ nationals recruited, but it remains below target and continues to lag behind in the  of women hired, which averaged 36.5 percent over the ﬁ ve years to the end of FY 2021 (Figure 8). If these trends continue, the cumulative impact may result in longer-term consequences on diversity in leadership roles. Together with diversifying recruits into managerial roles, increasing the  of women and MENA+ nationals into the individual contributor category should be given priority in the coming years. Over the last ﬁ ve years, women accounted for approximately 77 percent of hires in sta/uniFB00 grades A1–A8 and approximately 65 percent of contractual Support (S). These are slight increases compared to the ﬁ ve-year averages reported in 2019 and were driven, in the case of sta/uniFB00 positions, by spikes in FY 2020 and FY 2021. The IMF is slightly more successful in recruiting women as contractual employees than as sta/uniFB00 into the P/A9–A15 levels (38 percent vs. 36 percent average over ﬁ ve years, respectively). Greater variations are seen in external recruitments into managerial roles due to the low number of hires each year. Figure 9 depicts the ﬁ ve-year trend in recruitment of women into the di/uniFB00 erent grade groups.

Starting in 2018, the mid-career recruitment process has gone through a fundamental change. It has focused more on sourcing candidates from URRs, is run at set times during the year and is governed by the Economist Committee—the same committee that oversees the Economist Program. Recruitment of mid-career fungible economists from URRs has improved. Since the changes were implemented, except for FY 2019, the  of candidates hired from URRs has risen considerably, reaching over 50 percent in three of the ﬁ ve reference years. Men from URRs, however, have far outpaced women from URRs. More generally, the  of women in the mid-career pipeline remains well below the 50 percent overall recruitment target (Figure 12). 10 “Fungible economists” bring a variety of previous work experiences, often in areas of emerging focus for the IMF (climate change, for example). Mid-career hires undergo a competitive hiring process that includes a written assessment, preliminary interview, a mid-career panel interview, and Economist Committee clearance. They are then placed into a pipeline from which departments can select them. Figure 12.

DDC = Deputy Division Chief.Recruitments by career stream (Figure 10, panel 2), show a wide gender gap for Economists and gender balance for the Specialized Career Stream. On average over the last ﬁ ve years, economists represented almost 65 percent of hires into the A9–B5 levels, with female economists averaging a third of economist hires. The  of male economists hired from URRs has been increasing steadily and reached 28 percent in FY 2021, 4 percentage points higher than the ﬁ ve-year average (Figure 10, panel 3). On the other hand, the  of female economists recruited from URRs has remained constant. Among new hires, 36 percent were hired into Specialized Career (SCS) roles. Of these, slightly more than half were women, with an increase in the number of women from URRs hired in the last two years (Figure 10, panel 4). The hiring of sta/uniFB00 from URRs into managerial roles, particularly women, remains a considerable challenge. Over the last ﬁ ve years, 59 percent of managers hired externally were men, of which one in ﬁ ve were from URRs. Of the 24 women hired, three (12.5 percent) were from URRs—only 5 percent of external managerial recruitments (Figure 11). IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03 ce 12 Economist Program Like the mid-career process, recruitment into the Economist Program is central- ized and continues to deliver better diversity results than individual hiring. In the ﬁ ve cohorts from 2017 to 2021, the  of women recruited via the Economist Program has generally been more than 40 percent (Figure 13, panel 1), higher than the  of women graduating with PhDs in economics (between 30 and 35 percent). At slightly more than 36 percent, the  of URR nationals hired through this program has exceeded the 30 percent representation target set out in the Institutional Goals. Of the three underrepresented regions, nationals from East Asia were hired in higher numbers (Figure 13, panel 2). Continuing to increase the  of women and URR nationals recruited through this program will contribute to the pipeline of candidates for managerial roles in the long term. Figure 13.

EP Cohorts are selected on a yearly cycle with each cohort starting in September. Future Hiring Space The vast majority of IMF hires over the next three years will likely be at the A9–B5 levels. Workforce planning will inform the exact mix of external and internal hires as well as the employment type (Economist Program vs. mid-career) and contract type (sta/uniFB00 vs. contractual). Internal mobility will also create opportunities for sta/uniFB00 to beneﬁ t from career development and progression.Facing Remaining Recruitment Challenges As mentioned above, the IMF has made progress, but some challenges remain. Considering the elements and challenges presented in this Recruitment section, the following areas need to be prioritized to achieve the FY 2025 Benchmarks: 1. increase the  of women into individual contributor roles 2. increase the  of MENA+ nationals into individual contributor roles 3. increase the  of women recruited into managerial roles 4. increase the  of URR nationals in managerial roles 2020–2021 Report 13 Figure 14.

Excludes the O/uniFB03 ce of the Executive Directors.Whereas overall diversity is increased through external recruitment, diversity in senior technical and managerial roles is primarily aﬀ ected by promotions. As noted, few managers at the IMF are hired externally. /T_h e policy of sourcing managers internally allows the IMF to grow its existing talent and provide career advancement opportunities. /T_h is section presents recent trends in promotion rates in both the Economist and Specialized Career Streams. Trends for Economists The average rate of promotion from A14 to A15 over the last ﬁ ve ﬁ nancial years (FY 2017 to FY 2021) is 4.1 percent. When comparing rates of promotion among di/uniFB00 erent regions (Figure 14, panel 1), nationals from sub-Saharan Africa have been promoted at a rate higher than the IMF average, which is a positive change compared to the ﬁ ve years leading up to the end of FY 2019. For sta/uniFB00 from Asia (excluding East Asia), the rate of promotions is more than double the average, and sta/uniFB00 from many other regions are being promoted at rates similar to or above the IMF average, with the notable exception of Other Western Hemisphere. IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03 ce 14 In the ﬁ ve years leading up to the end of FY 2021, women have seen a higher average rate of promotion from A14 to A15 than men. For women from URRs, the average rate of promotion from A14 to A15 has increased by 1.2 percentage points to 4.5 percent (compared to the last reporting period FY 2015 to FY 2019) (Figure 14, panel 2). Women from Other Regions continue to be promoted at a rate above the IMF average. Even with higher rates for women, men from Other Regions are being promoted at a similar rate to the IMF average, though men from URRs were promoted at a rate slightly below the IMF average in the last 5 years. When looking at promotions from A15 to B1, the average rate for two regions is signiﬁ cantly above the IMF average of 7 percent. Sta/uniFB00 from MENA+ and Asia (excluding East Asia), with average rates of 13.9 and 10 percent, respectively, have been promoted at much higher rates than that of other groups (Figure 15, panel 1). The rates of promotion for other groups have remained similar to the previous reporting period, with some small variances. More importantly, while the overall promotion rates are generally low (and di/uniFB00 erences are correspondingly “small”), it is important to understand the magnitude of these “small” di/uniFB00 erences. For instance, among Other Western Hemisphere, one in thirty sta/uniFB00 is promoted while the overall IMF average is one in fourteen. For comparison, among MENA+ nationals, one in seven sta/uniFB00 is promoted. The average rate of promotion for women from URRs into B-level positions is much higher than during the previous reporting period but remains below the IMF average. In the period FY 2017 to FY 2021, the average promotion rate for women from URRs to B-level positions was 5.7 percent - an increase from 2 percent during FY 2015 to FY 2019 (Figure 15, panel 2). The ﬁ ve-year average rate of promotion for men from Other Regions has increased to 6.3 percent from 5.1 percent. Similar to promotions from A14 to A15, the higher-than-average rate of promotions from A15 to B1 for women is driven by the promotion of women from Other Regions.Figure 15.

Trends for Specialized Career Stream Staﬀ The IMF ﬁ ve-year average rate of promotion for SCS sta/uniFB00 from A14 and A15 to B-level is 5.2 percent, compared to 3.8 percent in the previous reporting period. Half the regions, including Europe (excluding Transition ), MENA+, and East Asia, show average rates of promotion higher than the overall IMF average (Figure 16, panel 1). Similar to economists, sta/uniFB00 from MENA+ have beneﬁ ted more from promotions than other regional groups, with the average rate jumping from 6.5 percent for FY 2015 to FY 2019 to 13.3 percent for FY 2017 to FY 2021. The average rate of promotion for sta/uniFB00 from Other Western Hemisphere remains below the average. Importantly, since FY 2015 (the start of the previous reporting period), the IMF has seen no promotions of nationals from sub-Saharan Africa for SCS sta/uniFB00 .Women from URRs have been promoted at a rate 1 percentage point higher than the IMF average. The average rate for men from Other Regions (3) is also above the average (Figure 16, panel 2)/uni003B whereas those for women from Other Regions and men from URRs are slightly below the average. The 2019 D&I Report provided data on promotion rates from the A1–A8 grade group to A9 and above. Despite the low number and rate of such promotions, continued reporting on this group of sta/uniFB00 is important. Table 3 provides an over-view for the period FY 2017 to FY 2021. On an average annual population of 428, an average of 10 promotions occurred each year, though none took place in FY 2020 and only one in FY 2021, bringing the average down for the entire period. When comparing the average rates of promotion by gender and region (Figure 17), men from URRs have been promoted at a higher rate than the average. All other groups are in line with the IMF average.

Areas of Focus to Address Promotion Challenges Ensuring a robust diverse pipeline for leadership roles and upholding a policy of growing talent will require some targeted measures in the coming years. The primary areas of focus should be on providing equitable opportunities for sta/uniFB00 development and strengthening the pipeline of eligible sta/uniFB00 for them to be in a position to: 1. Increase the rate of promotion into managerial roles for women economists from URRs. 2. Increase the rate of promotion from A14 to A15 for economists from sub-Saharan Africa, MENA+, East Asia, and the Transition . 3. Increase the rates of promotion into managerial roles for sta/uniFB00 from sub-Saharan Africa and Other Western Hemisphere in the Specialized Career Streams.Table 3.

Separations from the IMF remain generally low, although the Fund is starting to see an uptick in the number of retirements as foreseen in the 2019 D&I Report. The  of retirements is highest for A9-A15 sta/uniFB00 , in line with their overall population. The average rate of resignations over the last ﬁ ve years is 1.5 percent. Women from Other Regions and men from URRs are resigning at slightly higher rates than the IMF average. Trends In the ﬁ ve years leading up to the end of FY 2021, the total number of separa-tions has averaged roughly 5 percent of sta/uniFB00 . Separations ranged from a low of 132 in FY 2018 to a high of 162 in FY 2017, with FY 2021 also seeing an increase to 160 (Figure 18, panel 1). In each year, the highest  of separations was due to retirements (on average 60 percent), followed by voluntary resignations (on average 27 percent), and ﬁ nally other separations (on average 13 percent). In FY 2021, retirements accounted for more than two-thirds (67.5 percent) of separations.Figure 18.

IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03 ce 18 The highest number of separations has occurred at grades A9–15 (reﬂ ecting their higher  of sta/uniFB00 ). Among this group, there was an average of 56 percent retirements, 30 percent voluntary resignations, and 14 percent other separations (Figure 18, panel 2). In FY 2021, the  of retirements in this grade group rose to 64 percent. Similar patterns are also observed for the other two smaller grade groups, B1–B5 and A1–A8.When looking at voluntary resignations, the average rate for FY 2017 to FY 2021 is 1.5 percent. Men from URRs and women from Other Regions continue to resign at a slightly higher rate than the average. Women from URRs resign at a considerably lower rate (Figure 19, panel 1). These data are similar to the previous reporting period, with no qualitative change in the reported pattern. Figure 19.

Excludes the O/uniFB03 ce of the Executive Directors and Independent Evaluations O/uniFB03 ce.. 2020–2021 Report 19 /T_h e 2019 D&I Report emphasized that achieving numerical diversity targets is important and stressed that the IMF must also focus on creating a more inclusive work environment. One of the IMF’s core values is inclusion, and its workforce diversity can only be leveraged to better serve the membership and produce creative and innovative solutions if employees feel they are respected, that their opinions are valued, and that they operate in a safe environment. 11 The IMF also needs to ensure that everyone is given equitable opportunities to speak, shine, and engage in meaningful ways, and that by doing so their contributions are acknowledged and rewarded fairly. This section provides a summary of the IMF’s organization-wide e/uniFB00 orts to foster a more inclusive environment. 11 See broader evidence in McKinsey & Company (2018) - https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/ people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity on the business case for diversity and inclusion.Racial Equity Racial equity and justice are now squarely on the IMF’s D&I agenda. The numerous well-publicized killings of black people by law enforcement o/uniFB03 cers in the United States, the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in many  following the  in May 2020, and the increasing hostility toward Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic spurred the IMF’s Management and sta/uniFB00 into action to better understand race in the workplace and reiterate the commitment to the safety and equitable treatment of all sta/uniFB00 regardless of their race or identity. IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03 ce 20 Box 1. Racial Equity Initiatives and Actions Management reemphasized its zero tolerance for discrimination, bullying, and harassment. The IMF’s Managing Director (MD) and Deputy Managing Directors (DMDs) reached out to black employees and those from URRs to listen to the challenges they face at the IMF and committed to taking action to ensure any potential inequities are being addressed. The commitments included initiatives to be implemented in the short term: information and awareness campaigns, leveraging the Diversity Reference Group (DRG) community, and increased transparency on the allocation of annual perfor-mance review (APR) ratings and promotions, as well as more medium-term objectives such as exploring how to gather reliable quantitative and quali-tative data, a review of the mandate and process of the Review Committee, giving the Inclusion and Diversity Council (I&D Council) a more robust mandate, and actions arising from a D&I Survey.Black employees mobilized to create learning opportunities and propose concrete initiatives. A new Employee Resource Group (ERG), the Network of Black Sta/uniFB00 , was created and met regularly with Management and the D&I O/uniFB03 ce. ERG members’ practical proposals as to measures the IMF could take to address internal racial equity and justice have resulted in the hiring of a Senior Race Expert and the creation of a Racial Equity and Justice Advisory Group. The Advisory Group, comprised of members from within and outside the IMF, is tasked with providing advice, recommendations, and guidance on redressing racial inequity and its consequences within the IMF and will deliver a report outlining a broad strategy and recommended actions in early FY 2023. Diversity Resource Groups (DRGs) and regional groups came together to create the Racial Justice and Equity Speaker Series. The aim of this series is to provide learning opportunities for employees to understand the history of race in the United States, the impact of racial inequity on people of color, and how organizations can foster greater inclusion and equity. Since June 2020, eight  have taken place, many attended by more than 350 partic-ipants each, and the IMF Library created an Anti-Racism Resource Center to provide employees with materials on the topic.Departmental management teams a/uniFB03 rmed their support to racially diverse colleagues. Many held townhall meetings/uni003B provided safe spaces for employees to discuss their individual and collective challenges, both within and outside the IMF/uni003B o/uniFB00 ered resources/uni003B and worked actively with their DRGs to provide occasions to improve knowledge around racial justice and equity. These collective e/uniFB00 orts have led to broad acceptance that racial equity needs more prominence within the IMF. In addition to the work of the Advisory Group mentioned above, the D&I O/uniFB03 ce has been working with key stakeholders on a voluntary self-identiﬁ cation survey, which will include race/ethnicity, to gain a better view of the  of sta/uniFB00 of di/uniFB00 erent racial backgrounds in the IMF. These data, complemented by the results of a D&I Survey will provide valuable insights and allow better targeting of IMF initiatives. 2020–2021 Report 21 Sponsorship Program As a key recommendation from the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) recertiﬁ cation in 2019, the IMF established a formal Sponsorship Program. It will allow strong-performing individuals from underrepresented groups to be supported by a senior manager (Sponsor) who has knowledge of their work and can vouch/advocate for equity in treatment in terms of access to senior leaders, career-enabling assignments, career development, and career advancement opportunities. Sponsorship currently exists informally, but a formal corporate program will help mitigate the potential bias that stems from existing arrange-ments and beneﬁ t a wider pool of sta/uniFB00 . In the longer term, the program should also bring about greater progress toward the benchmarks. While EDGE recommended a Sponsorship Program for women, the IMF’s pilot program focuses on nationals from URRs. The IMF’s data show that URR nationals do not have easy access to career-enabling assignments and have not beneﬁ ted from career advancement at the same rate as other regional groups. Sta/uniFB00 from URRs also d that they often lack networks and role models because of the low number of their compatriots in managerial roles. The pilot program’s objective is to address this low representation of URRs in key pipelines for managerial roles and in managerial roles themselves. Although not the goal of the IMF’s program,  12 shows that sponsorship may result in higher rates of promotion for the targeted groups. It also allows the organization to beneﬁ t from the contributions of a broader range of talent and “hidden gems,” who can contribute in meaningful ways. Greater engagement and career satis-faction of the sponsored individuals may also contribute to greater retention of talent, helping build the relevant pipelines. The initial cohort for the pilot program consists of 26 pairings. Senior Managers were asked to volunteer as Sponsors, whereas Participants (those being sponsored) were put forward by departments based on a number of criteria, including grade level, track record of good performance, openness to feedback and coaching, evidence of being goal oriented, interest in working in other 12 Hewlett, Sylvia Ann with Kerrie Peraino, Laura Sherbin, and Karen Sumberg. 2010.

Sponsors and Participants were matched based on areas of work and work history, with careful attention being paid to ensuring no direct line of reporting between each pair. Sponsors and Participants have been provided with training. As the concept of formal Sponsorship is new to the IMF, it engaged a leading industry vendor to deliver workshops and provide tips and tools for success. The workshops, complemented by a playbook, addressed the following areas: 1. Di/uniFB00 erences among mentoring/coaching/sponsorship 2. Sponsor and Participant roles and responsibilities 3. The importance of relationship capital 4. Key activities and actions for a successful sponsorship relationship 5. Building chemistry The D&I O/uniFB03 ce will accompany the cohort throughout the two-year pilot period. Regular check-ins are planned to gather feedback and address questions and concerns. In addition, the D&I O/uniFB03 ce will facilitate peer meetings to allow each group, Sponsors and Participants separately, to  best practices and raise challenges in a safe environment. A survey will be conducted in early FY 2023 to take the pulse and course adjust if needed. Finally, the IMF will measure success and apply learnings from the pilot to open a fully-ﬂ edged program targeting a much wider audience. A set of perfor-mance indicators and measurements to assess the success of the pilot are being ﬁ nalized. The aim is to take lessons learned from the two-year pilot and adapt the model, where necessary, prior to extending the roll out to a broader set of Participants. Given that the number of sta/uniFB00 put forward for the initial pilot exceeded the number of available slots, the IMF may launch a second cohort, in FY 2023, if feedback after the initial 9- to 12-month period is positive. IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03 ce 22 Disabilities In the 2019 Report, the IMF committed to broaden the scope of its D&I activities to encompass more underrepresented groups. In December 2006 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities . 13 The IMF aims to gradually align, as much as possible, with this Convention. It embarked on this journey in FY 2021 and aims to continue making progress over the next several years. The D&I O/uniFB03 ce is engaging with key stake-holders to implement the necessary changes. The IMF has relaunched its former Working Group on People with Disabilities. The aim of this interdepartmental Working Group is to review the IMF’s current disability-related policies and practices and make proposals on potential improvements. The group will benchmark against similar organizations and the private sector to identify best practices for implementation. The D&I O/uniFB03 ce worked with sta/uniFB00 to create an Employee Resource Group dedi- cated to employees with disabilities and those who care for dependents with disabilities. The aim of this group is to provide an a/uniFB03 nity group, similar to those for other communities in the IMF, and to leverage its knowledge and experiences to ensure that policies, practices, IT tools, buildings, social media, and the like are accessible for all. The IMF is lagging signiﬁ cantly behind its peers in embracing and actively pursuing disability as a diversity priority. Many have in place clear policies and centralized budgets for reasonable accommodations, have implemented tools to make their internal and external websites accessible, and are increasing their e/uniFB00 orts to recruit people who identify as having a disability. The IMF is seeking to become current, meet minimum standards of accessibility, and increase its e/uniFB00 orts to accommodate and hire people with disabilities. 13 Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities - https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.htmlDiversity and Inclusion Training Mandatory trainings on unconscious bias and workplace harassment have been in place since 2018. These trainings, o/uniFB00 ered respectively by the D&I and Ethics O/uniFB03 ces, were updated in 2021 to provide employees with more recent and engaging content. All o/uniFB00 erings are through e-learning, allowing employees to take them at convenient times and at their own pace within a deﬁ ned deadline. These courses complement other diversity-related training such as Inclusive Interviewing Skills, components included in the Leadership Development Program o/uniFB00 erings and general management training courses related to perfor-mance management, communication, and managing teams. In addition, in response to requests from sta/uniFB00 and managers, courses on racial equity and mental health are currently being tested, launching by the end of FY 2022. Use of Preferred Pronouns Employees may use their preferred pronouns in their IMF signature on a volun-tary basis. In recognition of the growing number of people who do not identify as either male or female and following a successful IMF GLOBE (Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Employees) 14 event in May 2020 on the use of appropriate pronouns, CSF/Creative, with the support of the D&I O/uniFB03 ce and Management, agreed that sta/uniFB00 could indicate their preferred pronouns in their o/uniFB03 cial IMF signature (see example). The use of correct pronouns is a sign of respect for and accep-tance of sta/uniFB00 ’s di/uniFB00 erent identities generally, but especially those within the LGBTQ+ community. It goes some way to enabling sta/uniFB00 to bring another aspect of their identities to work – an important component of fostering an inclusive work environment. 14 IMF GLOBE is the a/uniFB03 nity group/sta/uniFB00 club dedicated to persons of the LGBTQ+ community. 2020–2021 Report 23PETRA DE BRUXELLES (she/her/hers) Diversity & Inclusion Advisor INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND The work on Diversity & Inclusion is conducted under the leadership and guid- ance of the D&I O/uniFB03 ce, but many across the IMF champion their own initiatives to foster a more diverse and inclusive work environment. Key partners for the D&I team are the departmental Diversity Resource Groups (DRGs) and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) or sta/uniFB00 clubs. Box 2 provides a few examples of innova-tive initiatives implemented by these champions, to address challenges they h a v e i d e n t i ﬁ e d . IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03 ce 24 Box 2. IMF Staﬀ Diversity and Inclusion Intiatives Talks by Charitable Organizations To present a culture that is compassionate, inclusive, and empathetic to the needs of others, one IMF DRG invited four nonproﬁ t charitable organiza-tions to present their role and how they impact quality of life for people who are facing challenges. To build solidarity in the department, sta/uniFB00 were also provided with information about volunteering opportunities and ways they could contribute.Safe Space to  Tough Experiences As a demonstration of support for colleagues, a DRG from one IMF depart- ment set up informal sessions and discussion fora on racial equity in which sta/uniFB00 were given the space to  their experiences of racism and racial equity following a departmentwide survey on the same issue. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Assessment Supported by their department’s managers, another IMF DRG conducted a department-wide survey to assess sta/uniFB00 perceptions of D&I issues. The survey was followed by thematic listening circles at which sta/uniFB00 could discuss the concerns raised. Racial Inclusion, Policymaking, and Economic Outcomes Another sta/uniFB00 group organized a panel discussion between IMF sta/uniFB00 and external experts to raise awareness about the disproportionate economic and health e/uniFB00 ects of COVID-19 on racial minorities. Advances Inclusion and Cohesion Chinese sta/uniFB00 members held a virtual Lunar New Year gathering and farewell parties and started IMF Chinese Sta/uniFB00 Association (CSA) letters to  work and life achievements. In addition, CSA leadership sought members’ input on their career development challenges and discussed ways in which they could be overcome.Advances Inclusion and/uni00A0Equity IMF GLOBE, which supports gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender employees, worked with the D&I O/uniFB03 ce to design the D&I Survey LGBTQ+ inclusive and established a Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity (SOGI) Analytical Working Group, which seeks to explore and understand the added value of nondiscriminatory policies toward LGBTQ+ populations to promote inclusive policy design. /T_h e 2019 Diversity and Inclusion Report identi/f_i ed accountability as a primary challenge the IMF faced in achieving its diversity objectives. This ﬁ nding was also supported by the 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group, which in its Report of November 2020 indicated “For the e/uniFB00 orts promoted by HRD and D&I O/uniFB03 ce to succeed, they have to be owned by departments and have buy-in from all managers.” 15 Recognizing the need to strengthen account- ability for D&I results, the IMF has rolled out several initiatives in the last two years. Signiﬁ cant e/uniFB00 orts have been deployed to improve accountability IMF-wide, including at the departmental, and individual manager levels, a summary of which follows. More generally, to keep the IMF on track, a Three-Year Framework was developed and presented to Management. Regular updates are provided on the status of initiatives against the timeline set out in the Framework. As many of the initiatives are ongoing, assessing their impact will be possible only in the medium to long term. Signaling from the Highest Level Management rea/uniFB03 rmed its commitment to Diversity & Inclusion. In September 2020, a new Diversity and Inclusion Statement 16 was published on the IMF external website. The statement rea/uniFB03 rmed that “The strength of the Fund comes from its talented and diverse employees” and clariﬁ ed that each individual is responsible for contributing to D&I at the IMF. The statement also sets out a number of commitments, such as attracting, retaining, and developing diverse talent/uni003B enforcing management accountability/uni003B and overcoming explicit and implicit biases. 15 Report on The 2025 Benchmarks - http://www-intranet.imf.org/departments/HumanResources/Programs/ Diversity/Documents/2025 Diversity Benchmarks Presentation to Board v10.pdf , November 12, 2020. 16 Diversity and Inclusion statement - https://www.imf.org/external/hrd/diversity.htmSetting the FY 2025 Benchmarks The 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group was constituted in September 2019 and completed its work in June 2020. The remit of the Working Group was to assess progress against the 2020 Diversity Benchmarks, formulate the new 2025 Benchmarks, and recommend policy solutions, which were endorsed by Management and presented to the IMF’s Executive Board. In setting the FY 2025 Benchmarks, the Working Group underscored that ambition needs to strike a balance with realism and equity, and identiﬁ ed four anchors: Equitable, Principled, Inclusive, and Clear (EPIC): • Equitable: aiming for gender balance • Principled: balanced s of URR based on quota & IMF business • Inclusive: a more holistic approach wherein everybody counts (contractual employees and A1-A8) • Clear: simpliﬁ ed framework To achieve the benchmarks, the Working Group also recommended initiatives concerning policies and practices. These were grouped into several topical areas: attracting diverse sta/uniFB00 /uni003B using incentives, ownership, and accountability/uni003B empha-sizing retention and career progression/uni003B and developing inclusion metrics and benchmarks. Some of the recommendations overlapped with existing or planned initiatives/uni003B others were new. 2020–2021 Report 25 Departmental Diversity and Inclusion Action Plans Without accountability at the departmental level, the IMF cannot achieve its D&I objectives. In November 2020, with the support of the I&D Council, the D&I O/uniFB03 ce rolled out Departmental D&I Action Plans in which Heads of Departments (HoDs) committed to high-level actions and more tangible initiatives. The plans provide departments with an overview of the diverse composition of their teams (stock) as well as the ﬂ ow (external recruitments). The full impact of the departmental D&I action plans can be appropriately measured only after a few years. An initial review at the end of FY 2021, however, shows that: • Implementation of concrete departmental D&I Action Plans has been a positive step in the IMF’s D&I journey as it has raised more awareness around challenges within individual departments. • Departments have set SMART objectives with concrete actions/initiatives to increase diversity in their teams and monitor diversity in key career develop-ment processes. • Departments are thinking more carefully and being more intentional about expanding sourcing to reach previously untapped candidate pools. • Many departments have been deﬁ ning “career-enabling” assignments. Accountability Framework For many years the IMF Accountability Framework (AF) has been the primary means of holding Heads of Departments accountable for achieving business results. The AF comprises a mix of business and people management indi-cators against which HoDs are evaluated and rewarded. Management meets twice yearly with each HoD to assess progress against the AF objectives and to course-adjust priorities as needed. In the past, the discussions have primarily focused on business results—those related to key achievements related to serving the membership or key business processes. In December 2020, a clear signal emerged as to the importance Management attributes to people manage-ment, including diversity and inclusion. The agenda inverted the order of the discussions/uni003B D&I and other human resource indicators were reviewed before business-speciﬁ c results. This shift has been a signiﬁ cant one in the culture of performance management for senior managers.Diversity and Inclusion Survey In March 2021, HRD launched a D&I Survey. The survey asked sta/uniFB00 (including contractual employees) to voluntarily self-identify across di/uniFB00 erent diversity dimensions—a ﬁ rst step in collecting broader diversity data—and sought sta/uniFB00 perceptions and experiences at the IMF related to belonging, inclusion, their managers, training & leadership development, and discrimination and harass-ment. The response rate of 43 percent compares favorably with similar surveys and allowed the team to extract valuable insights. This survey sets a benchmark against which the IMF will be able to measure progress in the coming years and hold managers accountable for creating a more inclusive, equitable, and safe working environment. The survey highlighted several issues of signiﬁ cant concern. More speciﬁ cally, some sta/uniFB00 reported not feeling valued or respected due to their identity/uni003B experi-encing and witnessing unconscious bias, discrimination, and harassment/uni003B being reluctant to report for fear of retaliation/uni003B or lacking trust in the IMF’s safeguarding mechanisms. On a positive note, a vast majority of respondents reported that their manager (in this case direct supervisor) creates a safe and trusting work environment for all team members, regardless of their identity. The Management Team, including Heads of Departments, is strongly committed to addressing the challenges identiﬁ ed. A plan of immediate next steps has been identiﬁ ed, with the aim of engaging in a bottom-up exercise to solicit more medi-um-term and sustainable actions. IMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03 ce 26 /T_h e strategic importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion is becoming increasingly accepted as a business priority that will help the IMF better serve its membership. /T_h e D&I sphere is ever evolving: addressing its related challenges is and will be a continuous journey. In the two years since the last report, while maintaining a keen focus on gender and regional representation, the IMF has embarked on a path to broaden the scope of diversity dimensions included in its portfolio and made strides to improve inclusiveness and strengthen accountability for achieving results. The IMF must keep in step with the evolving D&I landscape and ensure that, at minimum, it meets the same standards it is asking of its stakeholders. In addition to continuing to pay close attention to two main priorities for hiring and sta/uniFB00 development—gender and underrepresented regions—the IMF needs to take a more granular look at what it has actually achieved so far. For example, there has been progress in the  of women in managerial roles, but disparities exist among the women who have beneﬁ ted from these e/uniFB00 orts. The topic of inter-sectionality, the conﬂ uence of di/uniFB00 erent diversity dimensions such as gender and race or race and sexual orientation, is becoming more prominent. In future, it will become more important to look at the intersections of a broader set of diversity dimensions to identify and address unintended gaps that have emerged. The D&I Survey revealed that very few employees are aware of what the IMF does to accommodate people who identify as having a disability. In the next two years it proposes to raise the visibility of this important diversity dimension by engaging with its existing community of colleagues and external parties to evaluate current policies and accommodation practices, with a view to better enabling not only current employees, but also potential candidates, reassuring them that the IMF will address their reasonable accommodation needs, if hired. To achieve benchmarks, the IMF will focus its e/uniFB00 orts on external recruitment and developing existing talent so that they are ready to take on managerial roles. More speciﬁ cally, the IMF will leverage the additional hiring space provided by the business priority areas—climate change, gender inclusion, digital ﬁ nance, and closer engagement with fragile and low-income states—and the increase in sta/uniFB00 retirements. Table 4 sets out the recommended areas of focus and initiatives to be taken to address ongoing challenges. 2020-2021 Report 27 Table 4.

The pay gap analysis has been mainly focused on di/uniFB00 erences in pay by gender and underrepresented regions. In 2020, for the ﬁ rst time, the analysis relied on newly collected survey data to include race. The framework used in the estimations of the pay gap is fairly standard (see below) and is largely based on that used for the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) certiﬁ cation. Gender pay gaps and pay equity more generally remain a hot topic for human resources discussions and policies. Traditionally, studies have largely focused on gender and tend to show signiﬁ cant di/uniFB00 erences in remunerations that are hard to explain. At the same time, pay gap analyses have also become more sophis-ticated and have moved away from simple comparison of average pay across di/uniFB00 erent groups (e.g., men and women) and have sought to incorporate the main determinants of pay to pinpoint the e/uniFB00 ect of gender or race. 18 At the IMF, an early study found no major systematic gender pay di/uniFB00 erences based on data from 1999–2013 19. As noted above, the IMF has been conducting more regular pay gap assessments since 2017, in the context of the EDGE certiﬁ cation. To understand di/uniFB00 erences in pay across gender and other factors (such as race) a regression analysis focused on pay has been used. The standard framework used here allows one to assess whether the gender pay di/uniFB00 erences remain (a pay “gap”) after controlling for additional factors that could potentially a/uniFB00 ect internal salaries. The baseline esti-mated equation below follows EDGE’s standard regression form, which includes personal characteristics such as age, tenure, performance ratings and educational level, as well as job-related factors such as department type and career level. The latest pay gap analysis is based on data for FY 2020 and looks at gender, region, and race. 20 The data used include salaries and other individual char- acteristics of 2,800 IMF sta/uniFB00 , including age, tenure, nationality, or region, etc. 18 See PWC (2017 ) - https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/economics/insights/women-in-work-index.html and Payscale (2021) - https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap . 19 Maloney, Tim. 2015. “Final Report on the Salary and Career Progression Equity Study.” AUT Enterprises Limited, Auckland. 20 Due to the sample size, for this PGA an analysis was possible only for two groups, one Afro/Black and the second regrouping all other races/ethnicities.In addition, survey data were used to estimate the pay gap between sta/uniFB00 who self-identiﬁ ed as Afro/Black and the non-Afro/Black group. The survey data cover only about 40 percent of the larger sample and relies on data provided by sta/uniFB00 on a voluntary basis. The results from the pay gap analysis show relatively small di/uniFB00 erences in pay across gender and race. In the regressions considered, the combined e/uniFB00 ect of age, tenure, educational level, years in grade, and grade level all have a positive and signiﬁ cant impact on pay and explain most of the variation in sta/uniFB00 salaries (Annex Figure 1.1)/uni003B the same variables also explain most of the di/uniFB00 erences in pay across gender and race. The following ﬁ ndings are robust to a number of empir-ical checks, and applying the same framework to FY 2019 and FY 2016 shows broadly similar results.ANNEX 1.

Data include both sta/uniFB00 and contractual employees. 2020–2021 Report 31 In the case of gender, the results indicate that the pay gap is generally small, especially for economists (55 percent of IMF sta/uniFB00 ). In the sample, pay for women is about 3.8 percent lower than that for men, after controlling for the other factors previously mentioned. This overall gap is close to the +/–5 percent overall pay gap in similar industries and in line with EDGE speciﬁ cations. In the case of econ-omists, the di/uniFB00 erence across gender is only –0.9 percent, and it is not statistically signiﬁ cant. On the other hand, the di/uniFB00 erences across gender are larger, –5.4 percent for women, when considering sta/uniFB00 in specialized career streams (which in turn might reﬂ ect di/uniFB00 erent levels of the pay gap for a large number of distinct job functions). In the case of URR the e/uniFB00 ects are also generally small. In the baseline estimations used to assess the gender pay gap, the inclusion of URR does not alter the main results but indicates a small negative pay gap for URRs (below 5 percent). More speciﬁ cally, the estimated coe/uniFB03 cient on the URR variable indicates a pay gap of –1.8 percent (about half of gender coe/uniFB03 cient), and the coe/uniFB03 cient is statis-tically signiﬁ cant at the 5 percent level. Interestingly, the coe/uniFB03 cient is larger than in previous analyses using FY 16 and FY 19 data, and this trend will continue to be monitored closely. Finally, in the case of race, the analysis zoomed in on the pay gap between Afro/Black and the rest of the sample (all other groups). As noted earlier, the sample used in this case is about 40 percent of the sta/uniFB00 (about 1,200 observa-tions), based on the number of respondents to a question on race/ethnicity. In particular, the coe/uniFB03 cient on the Afro/Black variable is –0.3 percent, and it is not statistically signiﬁ cant. Worth noting: some sta/uniFB00 perceive a large pay gap based on race—these views do not align with the analysis. Other factors, such as career progression, may be contributing to these perceptions. 21 Given that only 15 percent of sta/uniFB00 self-identiﬁ ed as Afro/Black, no additional subgroups (e.g., Afro/Black econo- mists) were analyzed with this framework owing to the rather small sample sizes.

Consequently, a\\nmember’s provision of reserve assets to the IMF changes the composition of\\nthe member’s reserve assets—from, for example, U.S. dollars to claims on\\nthe IMF—rather than the overall size of its international reserve assets. As\\nthe borrower repays the IMF loan (repurchases its currency with reserve\\nassets), these funds are transferred to the creditor  in exchange for\\ntheir currencies, and the creditor’s claim on the IMF is extinguished.\\nA member’s purchase of currency reduces the IMF’s holdings of the cur-\\nrency purchased, enlarges the reserve tranche position of the country whose\\ncurrency is purchased, and increases the IMF’s holdings of the purchasing\\nmember’s currency.

Inter-\\nest is charged on the use of IMF credit, which is obtained through purchases\\noutside of the reserve tranche.

As\\nthe borrower repays the IMF loan (repurchases its currency with reserve\\nassets), these funds are transferred to the creditor  in exchange for\\ntheir currencies, and the creditor’s claim on the IMF is extinguished.\\nA member’s purchase of currency reduces the IMF’s holdings of the cur-\\nrency purchased, enlarges the reserve tranche position of the country whose\\ncurrency is purchased, and increases the IMF’s holdings of the purchasing\\nmember’s currency. Charges (interest) are not levied on purchases within\\nthe reserve tranche, as these resources are the member’s own reserves. Inter-\\nest is charged on the use of IMF credit, which is obtained through purchases\\noutside of the reserve tranche. A member can choose whether or not to use\\nits reserve tranche before utilizing IMF credit. Alternative financial posi-\\ntions of members in the IMF’s pool of resources in the GRA are illustrated\\nin Figure II.1.\\nThe currency purchased from the IMF must be that of a member with a\\nstrong external position, whose d currency is considered usable for\\nIMF transactions. If the currency purchased is not freely usable, the member\\nwhose currency is purchased is obliged to exchange purchased amounts of\\nits currency for freely usable currencies. If the purchased currency is freely\\nusable, the borrower can undertake transactions in the private exchange\\nmarkets or with the issuer of the freely usable currency to acquire a different\\ncurrency. A member whose currency is being used is obligated, if necessary,\\nto provide an amount of reserve assets of up to 100 percent of its quota. The\\namount of reserve assets provided to the IMF has in practice fallen well\\nshort of this maximum. In planning and executing members’ transactions,\\nmembers’ currencies are used in the financing of IMF credit according to\\ntheir relative quota s. In turn, members’ currencies are used in effect-\\n5This financing mechanism has its roots in the credit facilities that existed between cen-\\ntral banks before the IMF was established.\\n22']"

Postponement beyond the maxi-\\nmum period allowed under the arrangement would be considered only in\\nthe event that the IMF determined that discharge on the due date would\\nresult in exceptional hardship for the member and if the longer period for\\nrepurchase is consistent with the revolving nature of the use of IMF\\nresources. Such a decision requires approval by a 70percent majority of the\\ntotal voting power.19\\nA member is free to make advance repurchases at any time. At the discre-\\ntion of the member, advance repurchases can be attributed to any outstand-\\ning purchases. In this way, a member is free to reduce the IMF’s holdings of\\nits currency corresponding to prior purchases and thereby reduce or elimi-\\nnate its obligation to pay interest to the IMF.

    "content": "['FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\\nBOX II.8. RESERVE TRANCHE POLICIES\\nThe reserve tranche can be considered as the “facility of first resort.” It\\nstands apart from the credit tranches and the various facilities in that a mem-\\nber’s reserve tranche position is part of its own foreign exchange reserves. Pur-\\nchases in the reserve tranche do not therefore constitute use of IMF credit. To\\npreserve this character as a reserve asset available at the discretion of the\\nmember, the IMF has adopted reserve tranche policies:\\n• The definition of the reserve tranche (quota less holdings of the member’s\\ncurrency) explicitly excludes currency holdings arising from past use of IMF\\ncredit. This is intended to enable members to make purchases in the credit\\ntranches without having first to use their reserve tranche. The member can\\nchoose which resources to use first.\\n• Purchases in the reserve tranche are subject to a representation by the\\nmember of a balance of payments need, as with any use of IMF resources, but\\nthe member’s representation of need cannot be challenged by the IMF.\\n• Reserve tranche purchases are not subject to conditionality, charges, or\\nrepurchase expectations and obligations.\\ning from overdue obligations and the risk that debtor members in good\\nstanding might at some point fall into arrears. This latter risk increases with\\nthe level and concentration of outstanding credit, but is contained by the\\npositive economic effects of members’ adjustment policies and the IMF’s\\npreferred creditor status.

RESERVE TRANCHE POLICIES\\nThe reserve tranche can be considered as the “facility of first resort.” It\\nstands apart from the credit tranches and the various facilities in that a mem-\\nber’s reserve tranche position is part of its own foreign exchange reserves. Pur-\\nchases in the reserve tranche do not therefore constitute use of IMF credit. To\\npreserve this character as a reserve asset available at the discretion of the\\nmember, the IMF has adopted reserve tranche policies:\\n• The definition of the reserve tranche (quota less holdings of the member’s\\ncurrency) explicitly excludes currency holdings arising from past use of IMF\\ncredit. This is intended to enable members to make purchases in the credit\\ntranches without having first to use their reserve tranche. The member can\\nchoose which resources to use first.\\n• Purchases in the reserve tranche are subject to a representation by the\\nmember of a balance of payments need, as with any use of IMF resources, but\\nthe member’s representation of need cannot be challenged by the IMF.\\n• Reserve tranche purchases are not subject to conditionality, charges, or\\nrepurchase expectations and obligations.\\ning from overdue obligations and the risk that debtor members in good\\nstanding might at some point fall into arrears. This latter risk increases with\\nthe level and concentration of outstanding credit, but is contained by the\\npositive economic effects of members’ adjustment policies and the IMF’s\\npreferred creditor status. Reserves also provide a small amount of liquidity\\nin the GRA. The level and composition of the precautionary balances in the\\nGRA in recent years are shown in Table II.5.\\nReserves reflect accumulated net income and comprise the Special Reserve\\nand the General Reserve.
