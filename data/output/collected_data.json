and policies by the IMF staff, usually published twice a year, with updates in between. It presents analyses and projections of the world economy in the near and medium term, which are integral elements of the IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries and of the global economic system. They consider issues affecting advanced, emerging and developing economies, and address topics of pressing current interest. \n See also, the World Economic Databases \n August 3, 2025 \n \n \n \n \n \n Page: 1  of 10\r\n\r\n             \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n \n \n \n \n \n 2025 \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook Update, July 2025: Global Economy: Tenuous Resilience amid Persistent Uncertainty\r\n \n \n \r\n                                                July 29, 2025\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n \n \n \n Global Economy: Tenuous Resilience amid Persistent Uncertainty \n Global growth is projected at 3.0 percent for 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, an upward revision from the April 2025 World Economic Outlook. This reflects front-loading ahead of tariffs, lower effective tariff rates, better financial conditions, and fiscal expansion in some major jurisdictions. Global inflation is expected to fall, but US inflation is predicted to stay above target. Downside risks from potentially higher tariffs, elevated uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions persist. Restoring confidence, predictability, and sustainability remains a key policy priority. \n \n \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook, April 2025: A Critical Juncture amid Policy Shifts\r\n \n \n \r\n                                                April 22, 2025\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n \n \n \n A Critical Juncture amid Policy Shifts  \n The latest  World Economic Outlook  reports a slowdown in global growth as downside risks intensify. While policy shifts unfold and uncertainties reach new highs, policies need to be calibrated to rebalance growth-inflation trade-offs, rebuild buffers, and reinvigorate medium-term growth, thereby reducing both internal and external imbalances. Policies that promote healthy aging, bridge gender disparities, and enhance the alignment of migrants’ skills with local labor market demands can play a crucial role in countering slow economic growth and fiscal pressures, especially when coupled with infrastructure investment. \n \n \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook Update, January 2025: Global Growth: Divergent and Uncertain\r\n \n \n \r\n                                                January 17, 2025\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n \n \n \n Global Growth: Divergent and Uncertain  \n Global growth is projected at 3.3 percent both in 2025 and 2026, broadly unchanged from the October 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast with an upward revision in the United States offsetting downward revisions elsewhere. The near-term outlook is characterized by divergent paths, while medium-term risks to growth are tilted to the downside. Renewed inflationary pressures could interrupt the monetary policy pivot, with implications for fiscal sustainability and financial stability. The policy mix should balance trade-offs and rebuild buffers. \n \n \n 2024 \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook, October 2024: Policy Pivot, Rising Threats\r\n \n \n \r\n                                                October 22, 2024\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n \n \n \n Policy Pivot, Rising Threats \n The latest  World Economic Outlook  reports stable but underwhelming global growth, with the balance of risks tilted to the downside. As monetary policy is eased amid continued disinflation, shifting gears is needed to ensure that fiscal policy is on a sustainable path and to rebuild fiscal buffers. Understanding the role of monetary policy in recent global disinflation, and the factors that influence the social acceptability of structural reforms, will be key to promoting stable and more rapid growth in the future. \n \n \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook Update, July 2024: The Global Economy in a Sticky Spot\r\n \n \n \r\n                                                July 16, 2024\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n \n \n \n The Global Economy in a Sticky Spot \n Global growth is projected to be in line with the April 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast, at 3.2 percent in 2024 and 3.3 percent in 2025. Services inflation is holding up progress on disinflation, which is complicating monetary policy normalization. Upside risks to inflation have thus increased, raising the prospect of higher for even longer interest rates, in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty. The policy mix should thus be sequenced carefully to achieve price stability and replenish diminished buffers. \n \n \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook, April 2024: Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence \r\n \n \n \r\n                                                April 16, 2024\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n \n \n \n Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence \n The baseline forecast is for the world economy to continue growing at 3.2 percent during 2024 and 2025, at the same pace as in 2023. A slight acceleration for advanced economies—where growth is expected to rise from 1.6 percent in 2023 to 1.7 percent in 2024 and 1.8 percent in 2025—will be offset by a modest slowdown in emerging market and developing economies from 4.3 percent in 2023 to 4.2 percent in both 2024 and 2025. The forecast for global growth five years from now—at 3.1 percent—is at its lowest in decades. Global inflation is forecast to decline steadily, from 6.8 percent in 2023 to 5.9 percent in 2024 and 4.5 percent in 2025, with advanced economies returning to their inflation targets sooner than emerging market and developing economies. Core inflation is generally projected to decline more gradually. The global economy has been surprisingly resilient, despite significant central bank interest rate hikes to restore price stability. Chapter 2 explains that changes in mortgage and housing markets over the prepandemic decade of low interest rates moderated the near-term impact of policy rate hikes. Chapter 3 focuses on medium-term prospects and shows that the lower predicted growth in output per person stems, notably, from persistent structural frictions preventing capital and labor from moving to productive firms. Chapter 4 further indicates how dimmer prospects for growth in China and other large emerging market economies will weigh on trading partners. \n \n \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook Update, January 2024: Moderating Inflation and Steady Growth Open Path to Soft Landing \r\n \n \n \r\n                                                January 30, 2024\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n Global growth is projected to stay at 3.1 percent in 2024 and rise to 3.2 percent in 2025. Elevated central bank rates to fight inflation and a withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt weigh on economic activity. Inflation is falling faster than expected in most regions, amid unwinding supply-side issues and restrictive monetary policy. Global headline inflation is expected to fall to 5.8 percent in 2024 and 4.4 percent in 2025, with the 2025 forecast having been revised down.  \n \n \n 2023 \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook, October 2023: Navigating Global Divergences\r\n \n \n \r\n                                                October 10, 2023\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n The latest  World Economic Outlook reports signs that policy tightening is starting to cool activity despite core inflation proving persistent. Risks are more balanced as banking sector stress has receded, but they remain tilted to the downside.  \n \n \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook Update, July 2023: Near-Term Resilience, Persistent Challenges \r\n \n \n \r\n                                                July 25, 2023\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n Global growth is projected to fall from an estimated 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3.0 percent in both 2023 and 2024. The rise in central bank policy rates to fight inflation continues to weigh on economic activity. Global headline inflation is expected to fall from 8.7 percent in 2022 to 6.8 percent in 2023 and 5.2 percent in 2024. Underlying (core) inflation is projected to decline more gradually, and forecasts for inflation in 2024 have been revised upward.   \n \n \n \n \n         World Economic Outlook, April 2023: A Rocky Recovery\r\n \n \n \r\n                                                April 11, 2023\r\n                                             \n \n Description:  \n The baseline forecast is for growth to fall from 3.4 percent in 2022 to 2.8 percent in 2023, before settling at 3.0 percent in 2024. Advanced economies are expected to see an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from 2.7 percent in 2022 to 1.3 percent in 2023. In a plausible alternative scenario with further financial sector stress, global growth declines to about 2.5 percent in 2023 with advanced economy growth falling below 1 percent. Global headline inflation in the baseline is set to fall from 8.7 percent in 2022 to 7.0 percent in 2023 on the back of lower commodity prices but underlying (core) inflation is likely to decline more slowly. Inflation’s return to target is unlikely before 2025 in most cases. \n \n \n \n \n \n Page: 1  of 10\r\n\r\n             \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About \n Research \n Countries \n Capacity Development \n News \n Events \n \n \n Videos \n Data \n Publications \n Social Media Hub \n Annual Report \n Copyright and Usage \n \n \n Privacy Notice \n Contact Us \n Careers \n Glossary \n Scam Alert \n IMF Brand \n \n \n عربي \n 中文 \n Français \n 日本語 \n Русский \n Español \n \n \n \n \n \n © 2025 International Monetary Fund.

So the largely touted demographic dividend of previous decades is making way for a demographic drag.

And while trade, taxation, and other important policies are still guided by economic analysis, economists increasingly feel sidelined by politics.

Amory Gethin is an economist in the World Bank Development Research Group working on growth and inequality and has sought to quantify the economic value of education as it relates to global poverty reduction.

So when John Maynard Keynes looked for methods to measure economic fluctuations, animal spirits were a key ingredient. Karthik Sastry is a macroeconomist and assistant professor at Princeton University. In this podcast, he says personal instincts and primal urges are known to cause cycles of boom and bust, and one way to gauge those emotions is through economic narratives. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n F&D Magazine \n \n \n Oren Cass on the Invisible Hand \n \n \n OREN CASS \n March 3, 2025 \n \n \n Modern economics was built on ideas spelled out by Adam Smith in his 18th-century The Wealth of Nations. But while he used the term only once in that voluminous economic treatise, Smith is most remembered for “the invisible hand,” a metaphor that Oren Cass says has wrongly been associated with the idea that markets magically self-correct. Cass is the founder and chief economist at American Compass. In this podcast, he says the contortion of Smith’s idea led to a blind faith in markets, whereas “the invisible hand” was really about ensuring the alignment between private profit and the public interest.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Driving Change \r\n/\r\n                 Development \n \n \n Driving Change: Rumana Huque on the Real Costs of Bangladesh’s Tobacco Dependency \n \n \n Rumana Huque \n February 28, 2025 \n \n \n The International Economic Association’s Women in Leadership in Economics Initiative (IEA-WE) connects women economists worldwide and helps showcase their important empirical research, especially in developing countries.

Karthik Sastry is a macroeconomist and assistant professor at Princeton University. In this podcast, he says personal instincts and primal urges are known to cause cycles of boom and bust, and one way to gauge those emotions is through economic narratives. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n F&D Magazine \n \n \n Oren Cass on the Invisible Hand \n \n \n OREN CASS \n March 3, 2025 \n \n \n Modern economics was built on ideas spelled out by Adam Smith in his 18th-century The Wealth of Nations. But while he used the term only once in that voluminous economic treatise, Smith is most remembered for “the invisible hand,” a metaphor that Oren Cass says has wrongly been associated with the idea that markets magically self-correct. Cass is the founder and chief economist at American Compass. In this podcast, he says the contortion of Smith’s idea led to a blind faith in markets, whereas “the invisible hand” was really about ensuring the alignment between private profit and the public interest.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Driving Change \r\n/\r\n                 Development \n \n \n Driving Change: Rumana Huque on the Real Costs of Bangladesh’s Tobacco Dependency \n \n \n Rumana Huque \n February 28, 2025 \n \n \n The International Economic Association’s Women in Leadership in Economics Initiative (IEA-WE) connects women economists worldwide and helps showcase their important empirical research, especially in developing countries.

La croissance de la région devrait s’établir à 3,7 % en 2021, puis à 3,8 % en 2022. Cela fait suite à la forte contraction de 2020, mais représente toujours la reprise la plus lente par rapport aux autres régions.

Monetary Policy in Emerging Markets \n April 25, 12:30 PM EDT \n Emerging market (EM) central banks bolstered their credibility by tightening policy aggressively in response to the inflation surge and many countries have achieved a high degree of success in bringing inflation close to target.   But they now face an external environment of extraordinarily high uncertainty -- with major shifts in global trade policies and heightened geopolitical risks – as well as domestic political pressures to support growth and employment. This panel will consider the near-term outlook and risks facing EM central banks and will cover broader questions about appropriate monetary policy strategies for navigating this more challenging environment, and how EM central banks can use key tools such as foreign exchange intervention. \n Event Details \n \n \n \n \n \n See All IMF Videos   \n \n \n \n \n @IMFNews \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About \n Research \n Countries \n Capacity Development \n News \n Events \n \n \n Videos \n Data \n Publications \n Social Media Hub \n Annual Report \n Copyright and Usage \n \n \n Privacy Notice \n Contact Us \n Careers \n Glossary \n Scam Alert \n IMF Brand \n \n \n عربي \n 中文 \n Français \n 日本語 \n Русский \n Español \n \n \n \n \n \n © 2025 International Monetary Fund.

\n \n How does the IMF give policy advice? \n A core responsibility of the IMF is monitoring the economic and financial policies of member countries and providing them with policy advice, an activity known as  surveillance . As part of this process, which also takes place at the global and regional levels, the IMF identifies potential risks and recommends appropriate policy adjustments to sustain economic growth and promote financial stability. \n Want to know more? Check out the  latest surveillance press releases . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Why is IMF monitoring important? \n Vigilant monitoring by the IMF is essential to identifying risks that may require remedial policy adjustments. International cooperation on these efforts is critical in today’s globally integrated economy, in which the problems or policies of one country can affect many others. IMF membership, which includes nearly all the world’s nations, can facilitate this cooperation.  \n IMF monitoring focuses on individual countries or bilateral surveillance, and the global economy or multilateral surveillance. \n Want to know more? Check out this  video on how the IMF monitors the global economy . \n \n \n \n \n IMF POLICY ADVICE HELPS MEMBER COUNTRIES STABILIZE THEIR ECONOMIES,\nPREVENT FINANCIAL CRISES, AND IMPROVE LIVING STANDARDS \n  IMF staff engage in comprehensive discussions with various groups to better evaluate each country's economic policies and outlook. \n \n \n \n \n \n Country-level oversight or bilateral surveillance \n IMF monitoring typically involves annual visits to member countries. During these visits IMF staff have discussions with government and central bank officials about risks to domestic and global stability and policies and reforms to address those risks. \n \n \n \n \n These discussions focus on exchange rate, monetary, fiscal, and financial policies, as well as structural reforms. Discussions also extend to developments in other areas that are critical for economic and financial stability, such as climate change or digitalization. IMF staff typically meet with members of the legislature, representatives from business, labor unions, and civil society. Comprehensive discussions with a broad array of groups leads to better evaluations of each country’s economic policies and outlook. \n After completing their evaluation, IMF staff present a report to the   Executive Board  for discussion. The Board’s views on the report are provided to the country’s authorities, concluding a process known as an Article IV Consultation. In the interest of transparency, most member countries publish the staff report and accompanying analysis, as well as the views of the IMF Executive Board in a public statement   \n \nCheck out   this video on the IMF and Surveillance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Global oversight or multilateral surveillance \n The IMF monitors regional and global economic trends and analyzes the impact that member country policies may have on neighboring countries and the global economy. It issues periodic reports on these trends and analysis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n World Economic Outlook \n \n The  World Economic Outlook  provides detailed analysis of the global economy and its growth prospects, addressing issues such as the macroeconomic effects of global financial turmoil and the potential for global spillovers, especially those that may result from economic, fiscal, and monetary policies of large economies such as the United States, China, and the euro area.  \n Learn more   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Global Financial Stability Report \n \n The  Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR)  assesses global capital markets, financial imbalances, and vulnerabilities that pose potential risks to financial stability. \n Learn more   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Fiscal Monitor \n \n The  Fiscal Monitor  updates medium-term fiscal projections and assesses developments in public finances. \n Learn more   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n External Sector Report \n The  External Sector Report  analyzes the external positions of 29 of the world’s largest economies, plus the euro area.

The IMF analyzes member country policies to determine how consistent they are with the goal of sustained and balanced global growth. \n \n Learn more \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Adapting surveillance to evolving global challenges \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe IMF periodically reviews its surveillance work to reflect changes in the global economy. Its most recent  Comprehensive Surveillance Review , which concluded in 2021, provided a blueprint for global surveillance over the next five to ten years \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The review identified four priorities to better support members: \n \n Confronting risks and uncertainties Preempting and mitigating spillovers Fostering economic sustainability Adopting a more unified approach to policy advice \n \n At the member country level, the regular health check of members’ economies, known as Article IV Consultation, will continue to cover fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and financial issues. As climate change, digital technology, inequality, and global events such as a pandemic shape a changing world, the IMF’s forward-looking surveillance approach aims to give policy advice to member countries that is even more timely and targeted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related links : \n IMF Staff Monitored Program (SMP) \n|  IMF Standards for Data Dissemination \n|  Transparency at the IMF \n|  Factsheet List \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n|\n \n \n \n \n \n|\n \n \n \n \n \n|\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n LEARN MORE ABOUT\nTHE IMF  \n Subscribe to our newsletters \n \n Sign UP \n \n \n \n \n This page was last updated in July 2024 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About \n Research \n Countries \n Capacity Development \n News \n Events \n \n \n Videos \n Data \n Publications \n Social Media Hub \n Annual Report \n Copyright and Usage \n \n \n Privacy Notice \n Contact Us \n Careers \n Glossary \n Scam Alert \n IMF Brand \n \n \n عربي \n 中文 \n Français \n 日本語 \n Русский \n Español \n \n \n \n \n \n © 2025 International Monetary Fund.

providing them financial support to create breathing room as they implement adjustment policies to restore economic stability and growth. It also provides precautionary financing to help prevent and insure against crises. The IMF’s lending toolkit is continuously refined to meet countries’ changing needs.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What kind of financial assistance does the IMF offer? \n Unlike development banks, the IMF does not lend for specific projects. Instead, the IMF provides financial support to countries hit by crises to create breathing room as they implement policies that restore economic stability and growth. It also provides precautionary financing to help prevent crises. IMF lending is continuously refined to meet countries’ changing needs. \n IMF lending at-a-glance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Why do crises occur? \n The causes of crises are varied and complex. They can be domestic, external, or both. \n Domestic factors  include inappropriate fiscal and monetary policies, which can lead to large current account and fiscal deficits and high public debt levels; an exchange rate fixed at an inappropriate level, which can erode competitiveness and result in the loss of official reserves, and a weak financial system, which can create economic booms and busts. Political instability and weak institutions also can trigger crises. \n External factors  include shocks ranging from natural disasters to large swings in commodity prices. Both are common causes of crises, especially for low-income countries. With globalization, sudden changes in market sentiment can result in capital flow volatility. Even countries with sound fundamentals can be severely affected by economic crises and policies elsewhere. \n The COVID-19 pandemic was an example of external shock affecting countries across the globe. The IMF responded with unprecedented  financial assistance to help countries  protect the most vulnerable and set the stage for economic recovery. \n \n \nCrises can take many different forms. For instance: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Balance of payment problems occur when a nation is unable to pay for essential imports or service its external debt. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Financial crises stem from illiquid or insolvent financial institutions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Fiscal crises are caused by excessive deficits and debt. \n \n \n \n \n \n Often, countries that come to the IMF face more than one type of crisis as challenges in one sector spread throughout the economy. Crises can slow growth, increase unemployment, lower incomes, and create uncertainty, leading to a deep recession. In an acute crisis, defaults or restructuring of sovereign debt may be unavoidable. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   The IMF provides financial assistance and works with governments to ensure responsible spending. \n The IMF offers various types of loans that are tailored to countries' different needs and specific circumstances.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How IMF lending helps  \n IMF lending gives countries breathing room to adjust policies in an orderly manner, paving the way for a stable economy and sustainable growth. Policy adjustments will vary depending on the country’s circumstances. For example, a country facing a sudden drop in the price of key exports may need financial assistance while moving to strengthen its economy and diversify its exports. A country facing severe capital outflows may need to restore investor confidence by addressing the problems that led to capital flight —perhaps interest rates are too low, the budget deficit and debt are growing too fast, or the banking system is inefficient or poorly regulated. \n Without timely IMF financing, a country’s adjustment process may be more abrupt and difficult. For example, if investors are unwilling to provide new financing, the country may suffer a painful compression of government spending, imports, and economic activity. IMF financing facilitates a more gradual adjustment. Because IMF lending usually is accompanied by a set of corrective policy actions, it signals that appropriate policies are being put in place, encouraging the return of private investors.\nIMF lending also aims to protect the most vulnerable population via policy conditionality. In low-income countries, IMF lending is also typically meant to catalyze financial support from other donors and development partners. \n The IMF lending process is flexible. Countries that maintain a commitment to sound policies may be able to access resources with no or limited conditionality. The same is true for certain urgent and immediate needs covered by emergency financing instruments. \n \n \n \n \n IMF lending in action \n \n \n \n \n 1. \n \n \n First, a member country in need of financial support makes a request to the IMF. \n \n \n \n \n 2. \n \n \n Then, the country’s government and IMF staff discuss the economic and financial situation and financing needs. \n \n \n \n \n 3.  \n \n \n Typically, before the IMF lends to a country, the country's government and the IMF agree on a program of economic policies. This initial understanding, known as a  staff-level agreement (SLA) , is reached between IMF staff and the authorities of the member country. The SLA outlines the terms of a financial program or review but is not final until approved by the IMF Executive Board. In most cases, a country's commitments to undertake specific policy actions, known as policy conditionality, are integral to IMF lending. \n \n \n \n \n 4. \n \n \n Once the terms are agreed upon, the policy program underlying an arrangement is presented to the IMF’s Executive Board in a “Letter of Intent” and detailed in a “Memorandum of Understanding.” The IMF staff makes a recommendation to the Executive Board to endorse the country’s policy intentions and offer financing. This process can be expedited under the IMF’s Emergency Financing Mechanism. \n \n \n \n \n 5. \n \n \n After its Executive Board approves a loan, the IMF monitors how members implement the policy actions underpinning it. A country’s return to economic and financial health ensures that IMF funds are repaid so that they can be made available to other member countries. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n IMF lending instruments \n \n \n \n \n \n The IMF has several lending instruments to meet the different needs and specific circumstances of its members.  \n \nIMF members have access to the  General Resources Account  on non-concessional terms (market-based interest rates), but the IMF also provides concessional financial support (currently at zero interest rates) through the  Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust , which is better tailored to the diversity and needs of low-income countries.  The recently established  Resilience and Sustainability Trust  offers longer-term financing to low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries seeking to build resilience to external shocks at affordable interest rates.  \n \n \n \n \n Reflecting different country circumstances and challenges, GRA-supported programs are expected to resolve the country’s balance of payments problems during the program period, while PRGT programs envisage a longer duration for addressing them. The RST provides financing to address longer-term challenges, including climate change and pandemic preparedness. \n FOR MORE INFORMATION: \n The IMF’s finances \n \n The IMF’s lending arrangements with countries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Purpose \n \n \n Facility \n \n \n Financing \n \n \n Duration \n \n \n Conditionality \n \n \n \n \n Present, prospective, or potential balance of payments need \n \n \n  SBA \n \n \n GRA \n \n \n Up to 3 years but usually 12-18 months \n \n \n Ex-post, and ex-ante (prior actions) if needed \n \n \n \n \n SCF \n \n \n PRGT \n \n \n 1 to 3 years \n \n \n \n \n Protracted balance of payments need/medium-term assistance \n \n \n  EFF \n \n \n GRA \n \n \n Up to 4 years \n \n \n Ex-post, with focus on structural reforms. and ex-ante (prior actions) if needed \n \n \n \n \n ECF \n \n \n PRGT \n \n \n 3 to 4 years, extendable to 5 years \n \n \n \n \n Urgent balance of payments need/emergency financing assistance \n \n \n  RFI \n \n \n GRA \n \n \n Outright purchase \n \n \n No reviews /ex-post conditionality, but ex-ante (prior actions) possible \n \n \n \n \n RCF \n \n \n PRGT \n \n \n Outright disbursement \n \n \n \n \n Present, prospective, or potential balance of payments need (very strong fundamentals and policies) \n \n \n FCL \n \n \n GRA \n \n \n 1 or 2-year \n \n \n Ex-ante (qualification criteria) and annual reviews for the 2-year arrangements \n \n \n \n \n Potential moderate short-term balance of payments needs arising due to capital account pressures (very strong fundamentals and policies) \n \n \n SLL \n \n \n GRA \n \n \n Approved for a period of 12 months with successor SLLs possible \n \n \n Ex-ante (qualification criteria) \n \n \n \n \n Present, prospective, or potential balance of payments need (sound fundamentals and policies) \n \n \n PLL \n \n \n GRA \n \n \n 6-month (liquidity window) or 1 or 2-year \n \n \n Ex-ante (qualification criteria) and ex-post \n \n \n \n \n Longer-term prospective balance of payments need or balance of payment need created with policies  \n \n \n RSF \n \n \n RST \n \n \n Minimum duration 18 months, cannot exceed the concurrent UCT-quality program \n \n \n Ex-post, concurrent IMF  \n UCT-quality program  \n required  \n \n \n \n \n Non-financial/signaling instruments \n \n \n SMP 1  (incl.

These charges are designed to cover the operational costs of the IMF and support its activities, including those related to providing policy advice and capacity development to member countries. \n Read more in this FAQ \n \n Basic charges:  based on the market-determined  Special Drawing Rights (SDR)  interest rate – which has a minimum floor of 5 basis points – plus a margin established by the  IMF Executive Board  every two years (currently 60 basis points).  \n \n Surcharges:  high and prolonged borrowing of non-concessional resources is subject to surcharges. There are two types: \n \n Level-based  surcharges:  of 200 basis points are applied on the portion of GRA credit outstanding greater than 300 percent of  quota ; \n Time-based surcharges:  of 75 basis points are applied on the portion of credit exceeding the level-based threshold for more than 36 months (51 months in case of borrowings under the  Extended Fund Facility (EFF) ).  \n \n Commitment fee:  applied to the undisbursed portion of a loan. This fee is typically a small percentage of the loan amount. For most IMF lending instruments, the fee is levied at the beginning of each 12-month period on amounts that could be drawn in the period: 15 basis points for committed amounts up to 200 percent of  quota ; 30 basis points on committed amounts above 200 percent and up to 600 percent of quota; and 60 basis points on amounts exceeding 600 percent of quota.  \n In line with the  2024 Review of Charges and the Surcharge Policy , IMF staff is expected to provide granular projections of the cost of Fund borrowing and capacity to repay during discussions with country authorities on new GRA-financed, IMF-supported programs. \n Low-income countries (LICs) may borrow under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) on concessional terms. The  2024 Review Of The Poverty Reduction And Growth Trust Facilities And Financing — Reform Proposals  updated the facilities and financing terms available to LICs. As a result: \n \n Access policies have been adjusted to calibrate Fund financial support to the individual needs of LICs. Effective January 1, 2025, the access norm, which guides the level of access of Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and Stand-by Credit Facility (SCF) arrangements, is set at 145 percent of quota. Access limits remain at their current levels of 200 percent of quota annually, and 600 percent of quota in total, maintaining the higher levels that were decided as a temporary measure for 12 months by the Board in December 2023. The space between the norm and the limits provides significant flexibility to help countries with higher needs. \n Safeguards were strengthened and streamlined, centered around the access norm, and reflecting the level of risks associated with higher PRGT credit exposure and elevated macroeconomic vulnerabilities in many LICs. \n Effective May 1, 2025, a new interest rate mechanism will apply to new PRGT lending. Outstanding credit under financing approved before that date, as well as new disbursements under existing arrangements, including potential augmentation of access, will remain subject to the current zero interest rate. The new mechanism will set interest rates at zero for the poorest PRGT-eligible members (around half of all LICs), and a modest, but still concessional, interest rates for the others. \n \n \n \n \n \n Commitment fees are refunded to the borrowing member, in proportion to the drawings made. If a country borrows the entire amount, the fee is fully refunded. Additional commitment fees and/or refunds may also apply under certain circumstances, for example whenever arrangements access amounts or periods are increased or decreased or cancelled. \n \n Service charge:  a fixed charge on each amount drawn from  the GRA (currently at 50 b asis points, except for the  Short-term Liquidity Line (SLL)  which has a reduced rate of 21 basis points).\nFor detail on each type of non-concessional loan, see  Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) ,  Extended Fund Facility (EFF) ,  Flexible Credit Line (FCL) ,  Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) ,  Short-term Liquidity Line (SLL) , and  Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related links :\n What is the IMF? \n|  IMF Conditionality \n|  How the IMF Makes Decisions \n|  Factsheet List \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This page was last updated in April 2025. \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About \n Research \n Countries \n Capacity Development \n News \n Events \n \n \n Videos \n Data \n Publications \n Social Media Hub \n Annual Report \n Copyright and Usage \n \n \n Privacy Notice \n Contact Us \n Careers \n Glossary \n Scam Alert \n IMF Brand \n \n \n عربي \n 中文 \n Français \n 日本語 \n Русский \n Español \n \n \n \n \n \n © 2025 International Monetary Fund.

\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What is capacity development? \n Strengthening the capacity of institutions—including central banks, finance ministries, revenue administrations, statistical agencies, and financial sector supervisory agencies—results in more effective policies and greater economic stability. The IMF works with member countries to modernize their economic policies and make institutions more effective by providing demand-driven, tailored technical assistance and training focused on issues that are critical to economic stability and growth. Capacity development can help countries improve tax collection, modernize monetary and exchange rate policies, develop legal systems, strengthen governance, collect and disseminate data, and much more. \n LEARN MORE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What countries benefit from capacity development? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How does the IMF provide capacity development? How does it fund it? \n The IMF provides capacity development in various ways. Staff\nfrom the IMF’s headquarters may meet with country officials in person or\nremotely, or work in the country as a resident adviser. The IMF also\noffers  a\nglobal network of regional capacity development centers , and classroom and\nonline training for officials in member countries. Capacity development\naccounts for around a third of the IMF’s annual spending.  External partners  finance\nmore than half of the IMF’s capacity development activities through support to\nregional capacity development centers,  thematic funds ,\nand bilateral projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How does capacity development help countries? \n \n \n Capacity development helps countries in many ways.  \nHere are some of the areas where the IMF assists member countries through its capacity development work: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n How does capacity development fit with other core functions of the IMF?  \n The IMF’s policy advice and lending work help it to identify areas where capacity development can have the greatest impact. Capacity development work helps to increase member countries’ understanding and implementation of IMF policy advice. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How does the IMF monitor its capacity development work? \n The IMF Executive Board oversees capacity development to assess its impact and effectiveness. It last  reviewed the capacity development strategy  in 2024.\nThe IMF is working to improve how it plans and monitors capacity development. It is assisted by evaluations that measure technical assistance and training across the IMF. Evaluations help determine the degree to which technical assistance has improved macroeconomic stability, public finance management systems, financial governance, and the quality of economic statistics. Evaluations also determine whether training has improved job performance of government officials and enhanced their ability to analyze economic developments and assess policy effectiveness.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n|\n \n \n \n \n \n|\n \n \n \n \n \n|\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This page was last updated in April 2025. \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About \n Research \n Countries \n Capacity Development \n News \n Events \n \n \n Videos \n Data \n Publications \n Social Media Hub \n Annual Report \n Copyright and Usage \n \n \n Privacy Notice \n Contact Us \n Careers \n Glossary \n Scam Alert \n IMF Brand \n \n \n عربي \n 中文 \n Français \n 日本語 \n Русский \n Español \n \n \n \n \n \n © 2025 International Monetary Fund.

information on the work of the IMF has been in high demand throughout the years. Our factsheets are a popular information source, describing in plain English the IMF’s mandate and operations, as well as its role on issues of relevance in international economics and finance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What is the IMF? \n \n \r\n                                    The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, works to achieve sustainable growth and prosperity for all of its 191 member countries. It does so by supporting economic policies that promote financial stability and monetary cooperation, which are essential to increase productivity, job creation, and economic well-being.\r\n                                 \n \n How Does the IMF Make Decisions? \n \n \n \n Annual and Spring Meetings \n \n \n \n Selection Process for IMF Managing Director \n \n \n \n The IMF and Good Governance  \n \n \n \n Transparency at the IMF \n \n \n \n How Does the IMF Encourage Greater Fiscal Transparency? \n \n \n \n IMF Accountability  \n \n \n \n The IMF and the World Bank \n \n \n \n The IMF and the World Trade Organization \n \n \n \n \n \n \n IMF Capacity Development \n \n \r\n                                    The IMF provides technical assistance and training – known as capacity development – as one of its core functions. Capacity development accounts for around a third of the IMF’s annual spending. It is available to all members upon their request and is tailored to a country’s specific needs. Capacity development can help countries to improve tax collection and bolster public finances. It can help countries to modernize their monetary and exchange rate policies, develop legal systems, or strengthen governance. Capacity development also can help countries collect and disseminate data to inform decision-making.\r\n                                 \n \n \n \n \n Where the IMF Gets Its Money \n \n \r\n                                    The money the IMF loans to its members on its best – or non-concessional – terms comes from member countries, mainly through their payment of quotas. Multilateral and bilateral arrangements can supplement quota funds and plays a critical role in the IMF’s support for member countries in times of crisis.  The IMF’s current total resources of about SDR 982 billion translate into a capacity for lending of about SDR 695 billion (around US$932 billion), as at mid-December 2023.\r\n                                 \n \n IMF Quotas \n \n \n \n Special Drawing Rights (SDR) \n \n \n \n Gold in the IMF \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Financial System Soundness \n \n \r\n                                    Supporting sound financial systems Weak financial institutions, inadequate regulation and supervision, and lack of transparency have been at the heart of global financial crises. These have highlighted the importance of systemic risk monitoring and management, which is why the IMF has stepped up efforts to help countries support sound financial systems.\r\n                                 \n \n Monetary Policy and Central Banking \n \n \n \n The Fight Against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing \n \n \n \n Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) \n \n \n \n Early Warning Exercise (EWE) \n \n \n \n The IMF and the Fight Against Illicit Financial Flows \n \n \n \n \n \n \n IMF Policy Advice \n \n \r\n                                    How the IMF monitors the global economy A core responsibility of the IMF is overseeing the international monetary system and monitoring members’ economic and financial policies, an activity known as surveillance. Through surveillance at the global, regional, and country levels, the IMF identifies potential risks to stability and recommends appropriate policy adjustments to sustain economic growth and promote financial and economic stability.\r\n                                 \n \n Standards and Codes The Role of the IMF  \n \n \n \n IMF Standards for Data Dissemination \n \n \n \n IMF Staff Monitored Program (SMP) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n IMF Lending \n \n \r\n                                    What kind of financial assistance does the IMF offer? Unlike development banks, the IMF does not lend for specific projects. Instead, the IMF provides financial support to countries hit by crises to create breathing room as they implement policies that restore economic stability and growth. It also provides precautionary financing to help prevent crises. IMF lending is continuously refined to meet countries’ changing needs.\r\n                                 \n \n Protecting IMF Resources-Safeguards Assessments of Central Banks \n \n \n \n IMF Conditionality \n \n \n \n Post Financing Assessment (PFA) \n \n \n \n Flexible credit line (FCL) \n \n \n \n The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) \n \n \n \n Policy Coordination Instrument (PCI) \n \n \n \n The Short-term Liquidity Line (SLL) \n \n \n \n The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) \n \n \n \n The Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) \n \n \n \n The Stand by Arrangement (SBA) \n \n \n \n The Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) \n \n \n \n The Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) \n \n \n \n The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) \n \n \n \n The Stand by Credit Facility (SCF) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n IMF Support for Low-Income Countries \n \n \r\n                                    How does the IMF support low-income countries? The IMF assists low-income countries (LICs) with financial and other support. The IMF’s surveillance program provides continuous monitoring of member countries’ economic and financial policies. Discussions with country authorities focus on the impact of their economic policies on stability and growth and the desirable policy measures. Capacity building typically focuses on how LICs can boost domestic revenues, manage public finances and monetary policy, regulate their financial system, and develop statistical systems. Capacity building helps IMF member countries to design and implement sound policies and to advance toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.\r\n                                 \n \n IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries \n \n \n \n Debt Relief Under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative \n \n \n \n The IMF and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) \n \n \n \n Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A Guide To Committees Groups and Clubs \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About \n Research \n Countries \n Capacity Development \n News \n Events \n \n \n Videos \n Data \n Publications \n Social Media Hub \n Annual Report \n Copyright and Usage \n \n \n Privacy Notice \n Contact Us \n Careers \n Glossary \n Scam Alert \n IMF Brand \n \n \n عربي \n 中文 \n Français \n 日本語 \n Русский \n Español \n \n \n \n \n \n © 2025 International Monetary Fund.

    "content": " Glossary of Selected Financial Terms  \nThis glossary covers basic operational and financial terms used  \nin th e IMF Financial Data Query Tool  \n \nA \nAdjusted Rate of Remuneration  \nRate used to pay interest (remuneration) to members on their remunerated reserve tranche \nposition with the IMF.  \n \nAdjusted Rate of Charge  \nRate applied to charge members on their outstanding credit to the IMF.  \n \nAgreed Amount  \nThe Agreed Amount represents the maximum amount available for drawing under an \narrangement approved by the IMF ’s Executive Board.  \n \nAverage SDR Interest Rate  \nAverage of the weekly rates calculated at the end of each financial quarter for that quarter.  \n \nB \n \nBasic Rate of Charge  \nThe basic rate of charge is equal to the SDR interest rate plus a margin.  \n \nBasic Rate of Remuneration  \nThe basic (unadjusted) rate of remuneration is equal to the SDR interest rate.  \n \nBilateral Borrowing Agreements  \nBilateral Agreements are lending agreements between the IMF and a member country, or an \nagency of the member country, to supplement IMF lending resources.  \n \nBuffer Stock Facility  \nThe Buffer Stock Financing Facility (BSF), established in 1969 and eliminated in 2000, provided \nfinancing to members with a balance of payments need to help finance their contributions to \napproved commodity price stabilization funds.  \n\n Burden Sharing  \nA policy in place since 1986 regarding the sharing, between members paying charges and \nmembers receiving rem uneration, of the financial consequences to the IMF of overdue \nobligations. An amount equal to overdue charges (excluding special charges) and an allocation \nto the Special Contingent Account are generated each quarter by an upward adjustment of the \nrate of charge and a downward adjustment of the rate of remuneration.  \n \nC \n \nCompensatory Financing Facility  (CFF)  \nThe Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) was a special IMF financing facility established in \n1963. Until its elimination in 2009, the CFF provided resources to members who encountered \nbalance of payments difficulties, arising out of export shortfalls or excess costs of cereal imports \nthat were temporary and resulted from events that were largely beyond the members’ control.  \n \nConcessional Assistance  \nThe IMF initiated Concessional Assistance in 1976 through the establishment of the Trust Fund \nfinanced from the sale of part of the IMF gold holdings. In 1986, the IMF established the \nStructural Adjustment Facility (SAF) to provide concessional assistance to low -income countries \nby recycling resources len t under the Trust Fund. In 1987, the SAF was enlarged to include \nresources from bilateral contributors and renamed Enlarged SAF (ESAF). In 1999, the ESAF Trust \nwas renamed the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Trust (PRGF Trust). In 2006, the \nExogenous  Shocks Facility (ESF) was added as another facility to provide assistance to low -\nincome members facing sudden and exogenous shocks but do not have a PRGF arrangement. \nThe PRGF Trust was renamed PRGF -ESF Trust and provided assistance through two facilities : \nthe PRGF and the ESF. In 2008, the ESF was modified into two components to address \nworsening of global conditions: the Rapid Access Component (RAC) which provides emergency \nassistance in a single disbursement and a High Access Component (HAC) provided in  multiple \ndisbursements subject to reviews when more resources are needed. In 2010, the PRG Trust \nreplaced the PRGF -ESF Trust and assistance is now provided through three facilities: the \nExtended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF), an d the Rapid Credit Facility \n(RCF).  Concessional loans are provided at a subsidized interest rate.  \n \nCumulative Quarterly Burden Sharing Adjustments  \nRefundable resources collected on a quarterly basis under the Burden Sharing mechanism \nwhich is used by the IMF to compensate for income lost due to unpaid charges and to build up \nprecautionary balances through contributions to the Special Contingent Accou nt (SCA). See \nBurden Sharing . \n CVA Account  \nThe Currency Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Account records the amount payable to the IMF or \npayable by the IMF depending on whether the member’ s currency has depreciated or \nappreciated vis -á-vis the SDR since the last revaluation of the  balances in the IMF No. 1, \nIMF No. 2, and IMF Securities Accounts.  \n \nD \n \nDeferred Charges Adjustments (Charges)  \nRefundable resources collected on a quarterly basis from members with credit outstanding by \nadding an upward adjustment to the rate of charge. The purpose of these resources is to cover \nunpaid charges of members in arrears. Once members in arrears settle t heir charges, these \nresources are refunded to contributors. See Burden Sharing . \n \nDeferred Char ges Adjustments (Remuneration)  \nRefundable resources collected on a quarterly basis from members receiving remuneration by \nadding a downward adjustment to the rate of remuneration. The purpose of these resources is \nto cover unpaid charges of members in arrears. Once members in arrears se ttle their charges, \nthese resources are refunded to contributors. See Burden Sharing .  \n \nDrawn Amount  \nThe Drawn Amount represents the cumulative amounts disbursed under an arrangement.  \n \nE \n \nEmergency Natural Disaster Assistance (ENDA)  \nEmergency financial assistance to countries with urgent balance of payments financing needs in \nthe wake of natural disasters. Emergency financial assistance was disbursed rapidly and without \nthe need for program -based conditionality. ENDA is subsidized for  low-income countries and \nloans are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3 1/4 - 5 years after disbursement. In 2010, \nENDA was superseded by t he Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for low -income members, and in \n2012 —by the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) for al l member countries.  \n \nEmergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA)  \nEmergency financial assistance to countries with urgent balance of payments financing needs in \nthe wake of armed conflicts. Emergency financial assistance was disbursed rapidly and without \nthe need for program -based conditionality. EPCA is subsidized for l ow-income countries and \nloans are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3 1/4 - 5 years after disbursement. In 2010, EPCA \n was superseded by t he Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for low -income members, and in 2012 —by \nthe Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) for all member countries.  \n \nEnlarged Access Policy (EA)  \nThe Enlarged Access Policy (EA) was established as a temporary policy in 1980 as a successor to \nthe Supplementary Financing Facility (SFF) and expired in 1992. The policy enabled the IMF to \nprovide balance of payments assistance to members facing external payment imbalances that \nwere large relative to their quota positions. The policy allowed the IMF to provide resources \nunder stand -by or extended arrangements in amounts larger that would be available under \nother policies on the use of general resources and  for a period longer than under the IMF’s \nregular tranche policies.  \n \nExogenous Shocks Facility - High Access Component (ESF -HAC)  \nConcessional financing under the High Access Component of the ESF (ESF -HAC)(2008 -2010) to \nlow-income member countries facing balance of payments needs caused by sudden and \nexogenous shocks. Loans are repayable with a grace period of 5½ years and a final ma turity of \n10 years. In 2010 the ESF -HAC was superseded by the Standby Credit Facility (SCF).  \n \nExogenous Shocks Facility - Rapid Access Component (ESF -RAC)  \nQuick concessional assistance under the Rapid Access Component of the ESF (2008 -10) in the \nform of an outright disbursements to low -income member countries facing balance of payments \nneeds caused by exogenous shocks. Loans are repayable with a grace period  of 5½ years and a \nfinal maturity of 10 years. In 2010, the ESF -RAC was superseded by the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF).  \n \nExtended Credit Facility (ECF)  \nThe Extended Credit Facility (ECF), established in 2010 and formerly known as the Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), provides concessional financial assistance in support of a \nthree -year macroeconomic and structural adjustment program to eligibl e low -income members \nfacing protracted balance of payment issues. The loans are repayable in 10 equal semiannual \ninstallments 5½ - 10 years after disbursement.  \n \nExtended Fund Facility (EFF)  \nThe Extended Fund Facility (EFF) provides long -term assistance to support members’ structural \nreforms to address balance of payments difficulties of a long -term character. Drawings under \nextended arrangements are repayable in 12 semiannual installments 4½ - 10 years after \ndisbursement.  \n \n \n F \n \nFCL Principal  \nPrincipal repayments (repurchase) of Flexible Credit Line (FCL) loans.  \n \nFirst Credit Tranche  \nMember countries may make use of IMF credit to address balance of payment problems under \nCredit Tranche Policies or special policies called facilities. Under the Credit Tranche Policies, the \nIMF makes credit available in four tranches (segments), each equa l to 25 percent of a member’s \nquota. The First Credit Tranche represents use of IMF resources up to the limit of the first \ntranche on fairly liberal terms. Requests for use of IMF resources beyond the first credit tranche \n(in the upper credit tranches) req uire substantial justification for the expectation that the \nmember’s balance of payments difficulties will be resolved within a reasonable period of time.  \n \nFlexible Credit Line (FCL)  \nThe Flexible Credit Line (FCL) has been established to allow members with very strong track \nrecords to access IMF resources based on pre -set qualification criteria to deal with all types of \nbalance of payments problems. The FCL could be used both on a prec autionary (crisis \nprevention) and nonprecautionary (crisis resolution) basis. Members may request either a one -\nyear arrangement with no interim reviews, or a two -year arrangement with an interim review \nof qualification required after twelve months. Purchas es under FCL arrangements are repayable \nin 8 quarterly installments 3¼ - 5 years after disbursement.  \n \nG \n \nGRA Arrangements  \nThe General Resources Account (GRA) Arrangements comprise a variety of lending programs \nwith different disbursement schedules and maturities depending on the balance of payment \nneeds of the member.  \n \nGRA Charges  \nThe General Resources Account (GRA) charges are payable by a member on its GRA outstanding \ncredit. Charges accrue daily on the outstanding balance and are payable on a quarterly basis.  \n \nGRA Credit Outstanding  \nThe General Resources Account (GRA) Credit Outstanding represents total GRA loans disbursed \nto members less repayments.  \n \n GRA Purchases  \nGRA Purchases are loans (purchases) disbursed to members under facilities of the IMF General \nResources Account (GRA).  \n \nGRA Repurchases  \nGRA Repurchases are principal repayments (repurchase s) by members.  \n \nGRA Special Charges  \nGRA Special Charges are charges in addition to the basic rate of charge levied on financial \nobligations, including overdue principal (repurchases) and charges that are past due.  \n \nH \n \nHIPC Assistance  \nThe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Assistance represents resources provided eligible \nmember countries to help meet their debt service payments to the IMF. Disbursements are \nnormally dependent on receipt of sufficient financing assurances from other creditors.  \n \nI \n \nIMF No. 1 Account  \nThe IMF No. 1 Account represents part of the IMF currency holdings held in member ’s \ndesignated depository agency which is used for the IMF ’s operations, including, inter alia, quota \nsubscription payments, purchases, and repurchases. The No. 1 Account is a cash account. \nMembers are required to maintain a minimum in No. 1 Account equal to 1/4 of 1 percent of the \nmember ’s quota at all times.  \n \nIMF No. 2 Account  \nThe IMF No. 2 Account represents part of the IMF currency holdings held in member ’s \ndesignated depository agency and it is used for the payment of administrative expenses \nincurred by the IMF in the member ’s currency, e.g., expenses of the IMF representative offices.  \n \nIMF Securities Account  \nThe IMF Securities Account represents part of the IMF c urrency holdings held in member’ s \ndesignated depository agency which contain member’s nonnegotiable, non -interest bearing \nnotes encashable on demand.  \n \n \n IMF’s Holdings of Currencies  \nIMF’s Holdings of Currencies represent members ’ paid -in quota subscription in local currencies \nthat are held in designated depository agencies (e.g. , central banks).  Currency holdings are \nheld in three accounts: IMF No. 1, IMF No. 2, and IMF Securities Accounts.  \n \nN \n \nNet SDR Charges  \nThe SDR Department pays interest on holdings of SDRs and levies charges on the cumulative \nallocation of SDRs to participants (all IMF members are participants) at the same interest rate. \nParticipants whose holdings are below their cumulative holdings incur  net charges, i.e., the \ncharges net of the interest. Both SDR interest and charges accrue daily and are settled \nquarterly.  \n \nNew Arrangements to Borrow (NAB)  \nThe New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) is a standing set of credit arrangements under which \nthe participants (member countries and institutions) commit to provide supplementary \nresources to the IMF when these are needed to forestall or cope with an impairmen t of the \ninternational monetary system. The NAB is the facility of first and principal recourse in \ncircumstances in which the IMF needs to supplement its quota resources.  \n \nNotes Purchase Agreements (NPA)  \nTo supplement its capacity to provide finance assistance to its members, the IMF issues \npromissory notes to the official sector under the Notes Purchase Agreements (NPA). The NPA \nincludes a limit on the total amount that can be purchased during the term of  the NPA. Notes \nare issued at the time of a loan disb ursement to a borrowing member.  \n \nO \n \nOil Facility  \nTwo Oil Facilities were established in response to the oil price shock in the 1970s. The first Oil \nFacility was created in June 1974 and lapsed in December 1974. The second Oil Facility was \ncreated in April 1975 to provide additional financing, and lapsed in March 1976. Both facilities \naimed at providing supplementary financing to member countries facing balance of payments \nproblems and were adversely affected by higher oil prices. Loans under the Oil facilities were \nrepayable in 16 quarterly installments 3 –7 years after disbursement.  \n \n \n Original Arrangement Date  \nOriginal Arrangement Date is the date when the IMF ’s Executive Board approves the \narrangement.  \n \nOriginal Disbursement Date  \nOriginal Disbursement Date is the date when the funds were disbursed to the member.  \n \nOverdue Interest  \nOverdue Interest on PRGT loans.  \n \nP \n \nPrecautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL)  \nEstablished to meet actual or potential balance of payments needs of members with sound \neconomic fundamentals and institutional policy frameworks but with some remaining \nvulnerabilities that preclude them from using the FCL. Access under a PLL arrangement varies \ndepending on the duration of the arrangement, ranging from six months to two years, and \nmember -specific needs. Under a six -month arrangement, access could be up to 250 percent of a \nmember’s quota, with a possibility to be augmented to a maximum of 5 00 percent in exceptional \ncircumstances. For one to two year arrangements, the maximum access is equal to 500 percent of \na member’s quota for the first year and up to 1000 percent of quota for the second year.  \nPurchases under  the Precautionary and Liquidity Line a re repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3 \n1/4 - 5 years after disbursement.  \n \nPrescribed Holder  \nA nonparticipant in the SDR Department that has been prescribed by the IMF as a holder of SDRs, \nincluding nonmembers, member countries that are not SDR Department participants, institutions \nthat perform the functions of a central bank for more than one mem ber, and other official \nentities.  \n \nPRG Trust  \nThe Poverty Reduction Growth Trust (PRGT) had been originally established as the ESAF Trust in \n1987 to provide concessional assistance to low -income members and was subsequently enlarged \nand renamed. PRGT was previously known as ESAF (1987 -1999), PRGF (199 9-2006), PRGF -ESF \n(2006 -2010) Trusts. The PRGT provides financial assistance under  three facilities: the Extended \nCredit Facility (ECF) to address protracted balance of payments (BOP) needs, the Standby Credit \nFacility (SCF) to address short -term and precautionary BOP needs, and the Rapid Credit Facility \n(RCF) to provide rapid low  access with limited conditionality to meet urgent BOP needs.  \n  \nPRGT Arrangements  \nThe Poverty Reduction Growth Trust (PRGT) Arrangements represent lending programs \nproviding concessional financing support to low -income countries.  \n \nPRGT Credit Outstanding  \nThe Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) Credit Outstanding represents total PRGT \nresources disbursed, including outstanding Trust Fund and Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) \nloans, less repayments.  \n \nPRGT Disbursements  \nPRGT Disbursements are concessional loans disbursed to members under the Poverty \nReduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).  \n \nPRGT Interest  \nThe PRGT Interest is payable quarter ly by a member on its outstanding concessional loans . A \ntiered interest rate structure differentiates financing terms across groups of countries (Tier 1, \nTier 2B, and Tier 2A) with lower income members benefiting from more concessional terms.  \n \nPRGT Repayments  \nPrincipal repayments of concessional loans disbursed by the Poverty Reduction and Growth \nTrust (PRGT).  \n \nQ \n \nQuota  \nEach member of the IMF is assigned a quota, denominated in SDRs, that is based broadly on the \ncountry ’s economic position relative to other members. The size of a country ’s quota takes into  \naccount its GDP, current account transactions, and official reserves. Quotas determine \nmembers ’ capital subscriptions to the IMF, voting power, and the amount of financial \nassistance available to them from the IMF. Quotas are normally reviewed, and possibly \nadjusted, every five years.  \n \nR \n \nRapid Credit Facility (RCF)  \nEstablished in 2010 to provide low access, rapid, and concessional financial assistance to low -\nincome member countries facing an urgent balance of payments need. It is provided as an \n outright disbursement without explicit program -based conditionality or reviews. The RCF \nstreamlines the IMF’s emergency assistance for low -income members and provides flexible \nsupport in a wide variety of circumstances, including shocks, natural disasters,  and emergencies \nresulting from fragility. RCF loans have a grace period of 5½ years and a maturity of 10 years.  \n  \nRapid Financing Instrument (RFI)  \nEstablished in 2012 to  provide rapid and low -access financial assistance to all member countries \nfacing an urgent balance of payments need in the aftermath of commodity price shocks, natural \ndisasters, post -conflict situations and emergencies resulting from fragility without th e need for \na full -fledged program. The RFI has replaced the previous emergency assistance policy that \ncovered Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance (ENDA) and Emergency Post -Conflict Assistance \n(EPCA). Financial assistance is provided  in the form of outright purchases and outstanding \nprincipal (purchases) are repaid within 3¼ to 5 years.  \n \nRate of Charge  \nRate applied to charge members on their  outstanding credit to the IMF.  \n \nRate of Charge Adjustment for Deferred Charges  \nA refundable adjustment to the rate of charge that is made under the burden sharing \nmechanism.  \n \nRate  of Charge Adjustment for SCA -1 \nA refundable adjustment to the rate of remuneration that was made under the burden sharing \nmechanism and allocated to the first Special Contingent Account (SCA -1). \n \nRate of Remuneration  \nRate used to pay interest (remuneration) to members on their remunerated reserve tranche \nposition with the IMF.  \n \nRate of Remuneration Adjustment for Deferred Charges  \nA refundable adjustment to the rate of remuneration that is made under the burden sharing \nmechanism.  \n \nRate of Re muneration Adjustment for SCA -1 \nA refundable adjustment to the rate of remuneration that was made under the burden sharing \nmechanism and allocated to the first Special Contingent Account (SCA -1). \n \nRCF Principal  \n Principal repayments (repurchase) of Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) loans.  \n \nReserve Tranche Position (RTP)  \nThe Reserve Tranche Positi on (RTP) is equal to the member’ s quota less the IMF ’s holdings of \nthe member ’s currency in the GRA . It is part of the member’ s external reserves.  \n \nRFI Principal  \nPrincipal repayments (repurchase) of Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) loans.  \n \nResilience and Sustainability Trust (RST)  \nThe RST was established in 2022 to help low -income and vulnerable middle -income countries \nbuild resilience to external shocks and ensure sustainable growth, contributing to their longer -\nterm balance of payments stability. It complements the IMF’s existing lending toolkit by \nproviding longer -term, affordable financing to address longer -term challenges, including \nclimate change and pandemic preparedness.  \n \nRSF Arrangement  \nThe Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) Arrangement represents the lending program \nunder which eligible members can access financing under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust \n(RST). A concurrent IMF -supported program with upper credit tranche quality policies (UCT \nprogram) is required.  \n \nRST Credit Outstanding  \nThe Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) Credit Outstanding represents total RST loans \ndisbursed  to members less repayments.   \n \nRST Disbursements  \nRST disbursements are long -term loans disbursed to members under the Resilience and \nSustainability Trust (RST). RST loans under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) have a \n20-year maturity and a 10½ -year grace period during which no principal is repaid.  \n \nRST Interest  \nInterest under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) is payable quarterly by a member \non its outstanding RSF loans.  A tiered interest structure differentiates financing terms across \ncountry groups, with low -income members benefiting from more concessional terms . \n \nRST Repayments  \n Principal repayments of long -term loans disbursed by the Resilience and Sustainability Trust \n(RST).  \n \nS \n \nSAF Interest  \nThe SAF Interest is payable semiannually by a member on outstanding credit under the Structural \nAdjustment Facility (SAF), excluding additional interest levied on overdue SAF interest.  \n \nSCA-1 Adjustmen ts (Charges)  \nRefundable resources collected on a quarterly basis from members with credit outstanding by \nadding an upward adjustment to the rate of charge and allocated to the first Special Contingent \nAccount (SCA -1). These resources build up precautionary balances to protect the IMF against \npotential losses from members’ ultimate failure to settle overdue repurchase obligations. SCA -1 \nadjustments are refunded to the contributors when there are no outstanding overdue \nobligations, or at such earlier time as the IMF  may d ecide. See Burden Sharing .  \n \nSCA-1 Adjustments (Remuneration)  \nRefundable resources collected on a quarterly basis from members receiving remuneration by \nadding a downward adjustment to the rate of remuneration and allocated to the first Special \nContingent Account (SCA -1). These resources build up precautionary balanc es to protect the IMF \nagainst potential losses from members’ ultimate failure to settle overdue repurchase obligations. \nSCA-1 adjustments are refunded to the contributors when there are no outstanding overdue \nobligations, or at such earlier time as the IMF  may decide. See Burden Sharing.   \n \nSchedule Date   \nThe Schedule Date is the actual date when a member is scheduled to repay its obligation.   \n \nSDR Allocations  \nSDR Allocations are a distribution of SDRs to members by decision of the IMF. A general \nallocation requires a finding by the IMF that there is a global need for additional liquidity . \nAllocations of SDRs are made to participa nts in the SDR department (currently, all IMF members \nare participants)  in proportion to their quotas in the IMF.  \n \nSDR Assessments  \nSDR Assessments are levied on participants in the SDR Department annually to reimburse the \nIMF for expenses incurred in operating the SDR Department.  \n \n SDR Holdings  \nThe Special Drawing Right (SDR) is an interest -bearing reserve asset created by the IMF to \nsupplement members’ reserve assets. It is a purely official asset and can only be held and used \nby members in the SDR department, the IMF, and certain designated official entities. SDR \nholdings can be exchanged with other members for freely usable currency.  \n \nSDR Interest Rate  \nThe SDR Interest Rate is a weighted average of interest rates on short -term financial \ninstruments in the markets of the currencies included in t he SDR valuation basket. The SDR \nInterest Rate is determined on a weekly basis and is subject to a 0.050 percent floor . It also \nserves as basis for calculating interest paid and charged to members.  \n \nSFF Charges  \nSFF Charges are charges under the Supplementary Financing Facility.  \n \nShort -Term Liquidity Line (SLL)  \nThe Short -term Liquidity Line (SLL) has been established to allow members with very strong \ntrack records to access IMF resources based on pre -set qualification criteria to deal with \npotential moderate short -term balance of payment needs arising due to capi tal account \npressures. Individual SLL arrangements will be approved for a period of 12 months with access \ncapped at the normal annual access limit, and successor arrangements could be approved for as \nlong as the member continues to qualify and have the spe cial BoP need. Purchases under SLL \narrangements are expected to be repurchased in 1 bullet installment 12 months after the \ndisbursement. As the SLL is a swap -like facility with revolving access, it enables repeated (partial \nor full) purchases and repurchas es within and across SLL arrangements. Repurchases would \nreconstitute the member ’s right to purchase up to the maximum access approved.  \n \nStand -By Arrangement (SBA)  \nThe Stand -By Arrangement (SBA) is the most common type of credit arrangement designed to \nprovide short -term financial assistance. Purchases under Stand -By Arrangements are repayable \nin 8 quarterly installments 3 1/4 - 5 years aft er disbursement.  \n \nStandby Credit Facility (SCF)  \nEstablished in 2010 to provide concessional financial assistance to low -income countries that \nare experiencing short -term but not protracted balance of payments needs. SCF arrangements \nrange from one to two years. Loans are repayable in 9 equal semiannual i nstallments 4 –8 years \nafter disbursement.  \n \n Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF)  \nThe Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) was created in 1986 to provide concessional financing \nto assist low -income countries in addressing balance of payments financing needs arising from \nstructural weaknesses. The SAF was financed by reflows of Trust Fun d repayments, and its loans \nwere extended on the same terms with a 5½ years grace period and repayable in 10 years and \nat the interest rate of ½ percent per annum.  \n \nSupplemental Financing Facility (SFF)  \nDuring 1979 -1981, the SFF  allowed countries with a Stand -By or Extended Arrangements to \nobtain supplementary and parallel credits financed by the borrowed resources . \n \nSupplemental Reserve Facility (SRF)  \nDuring 1997 -2009, the SRF  provided financial assistance to member countries experiencing \nexceptional balance of payments difficulties due to a large short -term financing need related to \na sudden and disruptive loss of market confidence. Financial resources under this facility were \nprovided under an associated stand -by or extended arrangement and generally available in two \nor more drawings which were expected to be repaid by the member within 1 to 1 ½ years of the \ndate of each purchase, subject to extension of up to one year.  \n \nSystemic Transformation Facility (STF)  \nDuring 1993 -1995, the STF provided temporary assistance to countries in transition from \ncentrally planned to market economies facing balance of payments difficulties. Assistance was \nprovided in small amounts with low conditionality.  \n \nT \n \nTF Special Charges  \nTF Special Charges are charges levied on overdue Trust Fund loans.  \n \nTransaction Value Date  \nThe Transaction Value Date is the date of the financial transaction.  \n \nTrust Fund  \nThe Trust Fund (1976 -1981) was set up to provide special balance of payments assistance on \nconcessional terms to developing members. These loans offered a 5½ years grace period and \nwere repayable in 10 years, at an interest rate of ½ percent per annum.  \n \nTrust Fund Interest  \n The Trust Fund Interest is payable semiannually by a member on outstanding TF credit . \n \n \nU \n \nUndrawn Amount  \nAmount undrawn represents an amount that currently remains to be drawn under the \narrangement. For SLL arrangements, it is equal to the Agreed Amount less the balance of \ncurrent credit outstanding under the current or any previous SLL arrangements. For all other \narrangements, it is equal to the Agreed Amount less Drawn  Amount . \n "

Nor does it extend to the claims \nof participants in the expanded NAB; as such resources are to be provided by setting \naside a portion of the total credit arrangements under the NAB.

    "content": "19II\nGeneral Department\nIntroduction\nThe IMF’s resources are held in the General Department, which consists\nof three separate accounts: the General Resources Account (GRA), theSpecial Disbursement Account (SDA), and the Investment Account.\nGeneral Resources Account\nThe GRA is the principal account of the IMF and handles by far the larg-\nest share of transactions between the IMF and its membership. The GRAcan best be described as a pool of currencies and reserve assets built up frommembers’ fully paid capital subscriptions in the form of quotas.\n1 Quotas are\nthe basic building blocks of the IMF. They broadly reflect each member’srelative economic size, taking into account the quotas of similar countries.Quotas determine the maximum amount of financial resources that a mem-ber is obligated to provide to the IMF, voting power in IMF decision making,\nand a member’s share of SDR allocations. The financial assistance a member\nmay obtain from the IMF is also generally based on its quota.\nThe financial structure of the IMF rests on the principle that quota sub-\nscriptions are the basic source of financing for the GRA. A quarter of amember’s quota subscription is normally paid in reserve assets, with theremainder paid in the member’s own currency.\n2 Currencies held by the IMF\nare of two types, usable and unusable. A currency is usable if the issuingmember’s external payments position is strong enough for it to be calledupon to finance IMF credit to other members. Other currencies, that is, the\n1Reserve assets are those that are readily available and accepted for international pay-\nments, such as the four currencies currently recognized as “freely usable” by the IMF: the\nU.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and pound sterling. A freely usable currency is one that the\nIMF determines is widely used to make payments for international transactions and istraded in the principal exchange markets.\n2Prior to the Second Amendment of the IMF Articles on April 1, 1978, the reserve asset\nportion was paid in gold, and after that, in SDRs or “usable” currencies of other membersas determined by the IMF.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n20currencies of borrowers or financially weak members, are considered unus-\nable. Thus, a portion of the GRA’s pool of resources consists of currencies\nthat cannot be used, leaving the IMF’s effective lending capacity at about\nhalf of total quotas.3\nThe IMF may also supplement its quota resources by borrowing and\nthrough additions to its precautionary balances. These balances comprisereserves in the GRA as well as resources that have been set aside in the first\nSpecial Contingent Account (SCA-1) to protect against the risk of overdue\npayments. These resources are not segregated from other resources of theGRA and can therefore finance the extension of credit.\nWith its usable resources, the IMF provides financing to its member coun-\ntries. Members “borrow” from the GRA under the IMF’s “credit tranche”\npolicies or under special policies or facilities.\n4 The credit tranches provide\nfinancing for balance of payments need, arising from almost any cause,whereas credits under other facilities deal with needs arising from specifiedcauses. Financial assistance is typically made available in installments thatare linked to the borrowing country’s observance of specific economic andfinancial policy conditions that must be met before the next installment isreleased. These conditions are agreed with the member under agreements\ncalled “arrangements . ” Members using IMF resources pay a market-based\nrate of interest on their outstanding use of credit from the IMF.\nA member’s financial position in the IMF is measured by the GRA’s hold-\nings of its currency relative to quota. Members draw on the IMF’s pool ofmembers’ currencies and SDRs through a purchase-repurchase mechanism\n(Box II.1). A member obtaining resources from the IMF “purchases” either\nSDRs or the currency of another member in exchange for an equivalentamount (in SDR terms) of its own currency, and later reverses the transaction\n3A member with usable currency pays in a usable currency whereas other members pay\nonly the reserve asset portion in usable currency. Any member may pay the reserve asset\nportion in SDRs. Currencies are held by the IMF in depository accounts at members’ cen-tral banks. Payment of the nonreserve asset portion of quota subscriptions is normally in\nthe form of promissory notes (nonnegotiable, non-interest-bearing securities) that are con-\nverted into currency on demand.\n4GRA credit is normally governed by the IMF’s general lending policies (also known as\n“credit tranche” policies), as opposed to the special policies that apply to other types ofcredit. Both sets of policies are discussed in the section “Credit Outstanding.” IMF credit\nhas traditionally been provided in “tranches” (segments), equivalent to 25 percent of\nquota, as explained in the section “Credit Tranche Policies.” “Borrowing” is undertaken\nthrough the purchase-repurchase mechanism, which is discussed in Box II.1.\nII General Department\n21BOX II.1. T HE IMF’ S MAJOR  FINANCING  MECHANISM\nThe IMF’s lending is financed from the capital subscribed by member coun-\ntries. Each country is assigned a quota that determines its maximum financialcommitment to the IMF. A portion of the quota is provided in the form ofreserve assets (foreign currencies acceptable to the IMF or SDRs) and theremainder in its own currency. The IMF extends financing by providing reserveassets to the borrower from the reserve asset subscriptions of members or bycalling on countries that are considered financially strong to exchange theircurrency subscriptions for reserve assets.\nThe loan is disbursed or drawn by the borrower “purchasing” the reserve\nassets from the IMF with its own currency.\n1 Repayment of the loan is achieved\nby the borrower “repurchasing” its currency from the IMF with reserve assets.The IMF levies a basic rate of interest (charges) on loans based on the SDRinterest rate and imposes surcharges depending on the amount and maturity ofthe loan and the level of credit outstanding.\nA country that provides reserve assets to the IMF as part of its quota sub-\nscription or through the use of its currency receives a liquid claim on the IMF(a reserve, or reserve tranche, position) which can be encashed on demand toobtain reserve assets to meet a balance of payments financing need.\nThese claims earn interest (remuneration) based on the SDR interest rate\nand are considered by members as part of their international reserve assets. AsIMF loans are repaid (repurchased) by the borrower with reserve assets, thesefunds are transferred to the creditor countries in exchange for their currenciesand the creditor claim on the IMF is extinguished.\nThe purchase-repurchase approach to IMF lending affects the composition\nof the IMF’s resources but not the overall size. An increase in loans outstand-\ning will reduce the IMF’s holdings of reserve assets and the currencies of mem-\nbers that are financially strong and increase the IMF’s holdings of thecurrencies of countries that are borrowing from the IMF. The amount of theIMF’s holdings of reserve assets and the currencies of financially strong coun-\ntries determines the IMF’s lending capacity (liquidity).\nWhile the purchase-repurchase mechanism is not technically or legally a\n“ l o a n , ”  i t  i s  t h e  f u n c t i o n a l  e q u i v a l e n t  o f  a  l o a n .  S i mi l a r l y ,  I M F  l e n d i n g“arrangements” provide for drawings in installments upon the fulfillment ofcertain policy conditions. Thus, they are similar to conditional lines of credit.For ease of reference, these more commonly understood terms are often usedin this pamphlet rather than the unique internal IMF terminology.\n1In making a purchase, the member provides domestic currency to the IMF addi-\ntional to currency previously paid to the IMF for the member’s quota subscription.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n22by a “repurchase” of its currency held by the IMF with SDRs or the currency\nof another member.5\nMembers receive a liquid claim on the IMF (called a reserve, or reserve\ntranche, position) for the reserve assets they provide to the IMF. This claimearns a market-related rate of interest (called remuneration) and can be\nencashed on demand to obtain reserve assets from the IMF. Consequently, a\nmember’s provision of reserve assets to the IMF changes the composition of\nthe member’s reserve assets\n—from, for example, U.S. dollars to claims on\nthe IMF —rather than the overall size of its international reserve assets. As\nthe borrower repays the IMF loan (repurchases its currency with reserve\nassets), these funds are transferred to the creditor countries in exchange for\ntheir currencies, and the creditor’s claim on the IMF is extinguished.\nA member’s purchase of currency reduces the IMF’s holdings of the cur-\nrency purchased, enlarges the reserve tranche position of the country whosecurrency is purchased, and increases the IMF’s holdings of the purchasing\nmember’s currency. Charges (interest) are not levied on purchases within\nthe reserve tranche, as these resources are the member’s own reserves. Inter-\nest is charged on the use of IMF credit, which is obtained through purchases\noutside of the reserve tranche. A member can choose whether or not to useits reserve tranche before utilizing IMF credit. Alternative financial posi-\ntions of members in the IMF’s pool of resources in the GRA are illustrated\nin Figure II.1.\nThe currency purchased from the IMF must be that of a member with a\nstrong external position, whose subscribed currency is considered usable forIMF transactions. If the currency purchased is not freely usable, the member\nwhose currency is purchased is obliged to exchange purchased amounts of\nits currency for freely usable currencies. If the purchased currency is freely\nusable, the borrower can undertake transactions in the private exchange\nmarkets or with the issuer of the freely usable currency to acquire a differentcurrency. A member whose currency is being used is obligated, if necessary,\nto provide an amount of reserve assets of up to 100 percent of its quota. The\namount of reserve assets provided to the IMF has in practice fallen well\nshort of this maximum. In planning and executing members’ transactions,\nmembers’ currencies are used in the financing of IMF credit according to\ntheir relative quota shares. In turn, members’ currencies are used in effect-\n5This financing mechanism has its roots in the credit facilities that existed between cen-\ntral banks before the IMF was established.\nIIGeneral Department\n23FIGURE II.1.

Moreover,\nthe value of members’ currencies held in the GRA’s pool of resources is\nmaintained in SDR terms over time through periodic additions to the\namounts of currencies that are depreciating against the SDR and reductionsfrom those that are appreciating against the SDR. This maintenance of value\nprovision is an obligation of members under the Articles.\n7\nSpecial Disbursement Account\nThe Special Disbursement Account (SDA) is the vehicle for receiving and\ninvesting profits from the sale of the IMF’s gold (i.e., the net proceeds in\nexcess of the book value of SDR 35 a fine ounce), and for making transfersto other accounts for special purposes authorized in the Articles, in particu-\nlar for financial assistance to low-income members of the IMF.\nInvestment Account\nThe IMF is authorized to establish an Investment Account in the General\nDepartment; to date, however, no decision has been taken to this effect.\nInvestments of amounts up to the level of accumulated reserves may bemade only in income-generating marketable obligations of international\nfinancial organizations or of the member whose currency is used for the\ninvestment.\n8 The income may be reinvested or used to meet the expenses of\nconducting the business of the IMF, including both operational and adminis-\ntrative expenses.\n6For an analysis of the key elements underlying the GRA’s costs and revenues and past\nproposals for simplification or modification, see “Financing the Fund’s Operations—\nReview of Issues,” March 2000, on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/\nffo/2001/fin.htm).\n7Article V , Section 11 (a).\n8The resources in the GRA are managed in such a way as to lower the IMF’s costs or to\nincrease the IMF’s revenue. In order to be more profitable than GRA resources, resources\nin an Investment Account would need to be invested at a rate that exceeds the SDR inter-est rate after taking into account any exchange risk.\nII General Department\n25The Balance Sheet\nThe relationships among the sources and uses of resources in the General\nDepartment, and their relative magnitudes, are summarized in its balancesheet (Table II.1).\nOn the asset side, the first major item is credit outstanding at the end of\nFY2001 of SDR 42.2 billion, which is the value of financing extended by the\nIMF to its members. Financing to debtor members is largely funded by theuse of the currencies of creditor members and is reflected in the resultingreserve tranche positions of creditor members (see Box II.1). Members withoutstanding credit pay a market-related rate of interest on these loans whichfully covers the payment of interest to the creditors providing the resources\nto the IMF, as further explained below. The vast bulk of other assets held by\nthe IMF in the GRA was usable and other currencies, equal to SDR 165.7 bil-lion. Gold, valued at SDR 5.9 billion, represented a relatively small share oftotal assets.\n9 The IMF receives no interest on its gold or currency holdings\nthat do not result from the extension of IMF credit. The only interest-bearingasset held by the IMF other than its outstanding credit is its holdings of\nSDRs, which were SDR 2.4 billion. With the addition of some minor receiv-\nables and other assets, total assets of the GRA at end-April 2001 amountedto SDR 217.5 billion.\nOn the resources and liabilities side, total quota resources were SDR 212.4\nbillion on April 30, 2001. As noted above, some of these subscriptionresources were usable and some were not. Usable currencies amounted to\nSDR 109.7 billion and unusable currencies SDR 56.0 billion. In addition,\nthere were SDR 46.7 billion in reserve tranche positions of members. Thereserve tranche positions of IMF members result from initial quota paymentsand the increase due to the extension of IMF credit to other members. Thesereserve positions earn a market-related rate of return, as explained below.Precautionary balances, which include reserves and the balance in the Special\nContingent Account (SCA), amounted to an additional SDR 4.5 billion. Add-\ning a small amount of interest (remuneration) payable and some other minorliabilities gives a total of SDR 217.5 billion of GRA resources and liabilities.\n9The IMF’s holdings of gold are valued at historical cost. For most of the gold holdings,\nthis is SDR 35 a fine ounce. Market prices for gold are much higher, which imparts a funda-\nmental strength to the IMF’s financial position. See the discussion below in the section on“Gold Holdings.”\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n26TABLE  II.1.

A comparison of the relative size of theseresources and liabilities demonstrates that the IMF is overwhelmingly aquota-based institution.\nII General Department\n27The rest of the General Department consists solely of the relatively small\namount of assets and liabilities of the SDA, SDR 2.8 billion at end-April\n2001. These represent the accumulated resources of the account, which\nreflect the profits and investment returns realized on past gold sales on theresources side, and the investment of these resources on the asset side. Theincome from these investments is transferred to the PRGF and PRGF-HIPCTrusts to provide concessional financial assistance to low-income members.There was also a small amount (SDR 0.4 billion) of loans still outstanding\nfrom the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) at end-April 2001.\n10 T hese\nloans were financed with SDA resources.\nThe remainder of this chapter expands upon the above discussion. It first\ndiscusses each item on the asset side of the GRA —namely, credit outstand-\ning, which includes a description of the various terms and conditions of IMFlending, followed by relatively short sections on currency, SDR, and gold\nholdings. It then describes each item on the resources and liabilities side of\nthe GRA\n—namely, quotas, including reserve tranche positions, and precau-\ntionary balances. Next, the chapter explains how the supply of and demandfor GRA resources is managed through the quarterly financial transactionsplan, and how the IMF monitors its overall level of liquidity in the GRA.Finally, it shows how IMF transactions are reflected in the accounts and bal-\nance sheets of member countries.\nThe management and investment strategy for the resources in the SDA is\ncovered in Chapter IV .\nThe Asset Side\nCredit Outstanding\nCredit outstanding, as the caption suggests, represents loans already pro-\nvided to members under the various IMF facilities. This section firstdescribes the general terms and conditions of IMF lending, followed by a\ndiscussion of the IMF’s financial policies and lending facilities.\n10The SAF is discussed in Chapter IV .\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n28General Terms and Conditions\nBalance of Payments Need\nMembers using IMF resources must have a balance of payments need. A\nborrowing member cannot use IMF resources in the absence of a represen-\ntation of balance of payments need, and the extent of their use cannot\nexceed that need. Borrowing usually takes place under an IMF arrange-ment, which is similar to a conditional line of credit and is associated with\nthe implementation of an economic reform program in a member country.\nThe most common type of arrangement is a Stand-By Arrangement in thecredit tranches or an arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility\n(EFF).\n11 Such arrangements can be approved on the basis of a prospective\nbalance of payments need, although the existence of a balance of paymentsneed does not, in itself, entitle a member to draw on the IMF.\nThe concept of balance of payments need has evolved over time. The con-\ncept includes three distinct elements: the balance of payments position ofthe member, its foreign reserve position, and developments in its reserve\nposition.\n12 These three elements are regarded as separate, and a representa-\ntion of need can be based on any one of them. An operational frameworkhas been developed over the years to serve as the basis for judgments on the\nmagnitude of balance of payments deficits and the adequacy of foreign\nreserves. In the implementation of this framework, the circumstances ofmembers are taken into account.\nOnce an arrangement has been approved by the IMF, a member’s repre-\nsentation of balance of payments need to make a purchase is not subject tochallenge, under a long-standing policy intended to assure the member of\nthe availability of IMF resources committed to it, subject only to its meeting\nconditions specified in the arrangement. However, the IMF may take reme-dial action after a purchase under an arrangement or a reserve tranche pur-\nchase if it finds that the conditions for the purchase were not met, including\nthat of balance of payments need.\nOther conditions may also be required. The IMF’s policies under particu-\nlar facilities may also stipulate requirements concerning the origins and\nnature of the underlying balance of payments disequilibrium. For instance,\n11See discussion below under “Financial Policies and Facilities.”\n12Article V, Section 3 (b)(ii).\nII General Department\n29the use of the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) is restricted to tempo-\nrary balance of payments deficits arising from overall export shortfalls orincreased costs of specified cereal imports.\nAccess Policy\nThe policy of the IMF is to encourage members to approach it for assis-\ntance at an early stage of their balance of payments difficulties. Members\nexperiencing balance of payments problems can approach the IMF, but are\nunder no obligation to do so at any time. Over the years, it has come to be\nrecognized that the efficacy of the mixture of adjustment polices and financ-\ning depends largely on the early adoption of corrective policy measures.\nEarly resort to an adjustment program supported by IMF resources can help\nto avoid more drastic policy actions that may otherwise be required, thereby\nlimiting the impact of the adjustment on other members.\nQuantitative limits on access are used to ensure equal treatment of mem-\nbers. Access limits are set in terms of quota, the basic measure of members’\nfinancial rights and obligations in the IMF. For the credit tranches and the\nEFF, which account for the lion’s share of IMF lending, the current limits\ntake the form of an annual limit of 100 percent of quota on purchases over\nany 12-month period and a cumulative limit of 300 percent of quota on the\nlevel of IMF credit outstanding. Average annual access under these lending\narrangements in recent years has been 40–50 percent of quota (Figure II.2).\nOther IMF facilities are subject to separate access limits or, in some cases,\nno explicit limits (Box II.2). In exceptional circumstances, these limits can be\nwaived, as they were for members most immediately affected by the severe\nfinancial crises of the late 1990s.\nThe level of access to GRA resources under Stand-By Arrangements and\nthe EFF —that is, the amount that can be borrowed —is based on criteria\nthat are applied uniformly to all members. These criteria seek to balance the\nneeds of members against the overarching responsibility of the institution to\nsafeguard and ensure the temporary use of its resources. The criteria are:\n• actual or potential need for resources from the IMF, taking into account\nother sources of financing and the desirability of maintaining a reason-\nable level of reserves;\n• ability to service indebtedness to the IMF, thereby protecting the\nrevolving character of IMF resources;\n• amount of the outstanding use of IMF credit and record in using IMF\nresoures in the past.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n30Phasing of Purchases\nAn important feature of IMF lending is the phasing of disbursements. All\narrangements above 25 percent of quota in the credit tranches —the upper\ncredit tranches —and under the EFF are subject to conditionality and the\nphasing of purchases (see Chapter V). Purchases in the first credit tranche\n(up to 25 percent of quota) are not phased, but do incorporate some policy\nconditionality.\nPhasing refers to the practice of making IMF resources available in install-\nments over the period of an arrangement, typically quarterly, subject to the\nobservance of performance criteria, the completion of a program review, or\nboth.13 This is intended to ensure that IMF financing goes hand in hand with\n13An “arrangement” is an assurance by the IMF that it stands ready to provide foreign\nexchange or SDRs under certain conditions during a specified period of time. The arrange-\nment is in support of a detailed economic “adjustment program” of the member. See theGlossary for definitions of these terms.FIGURE II.2.

T HE FRAMEWORK  FOR ACCESS  TO IMF R ESOURCES\nQuota-based access limits\n•T h e  credit tranches  (mainly accessed through Stand-By Arrangements)\nand the Extended Fund Facility  (EF F)  ar e su b j e ct t o t he  sa me a cc es s li mits .\nThese consist of an annual limit of 100 percent of quota and a cumulative limit\nof 300 percent of quota. The annual limit applies to gross purchases in any 12-\nmonth period. The cumulative limit applies to credit outstanding, less sched-uled repurchases, plus scheduled purchases, over the period of commitment ofresources. These limits may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Aver-age annual access has been fairly stable at around half of the annual limit inrecent years (see Figure II.2).\n• Access under the Compensatory Financing Facility  (CFF) is subject to its\nown limits. These limits are cumulative, and include limits of 45 percent ofquota each for access under the export shortfalls and excess cereal imports ele-ments, and a combined limit of 55 percent of quota. These limits cannot beexceeded.\n• T h e  a mo u n t  o f  emergency assistance  f o r  n a t u r a l  d i s a s t e r s  a n d  f o r  p o s t -\nconflict cases is limited, in any one instance, to 25 percent of quota. Largeramounts can be made available on an exceptional basis in post-conflict cases.Emergency assistance was until recently subject to the access limits under thecredit tranches but was converted into a facility and excluded from theseaccess limits, pending further review.\nAccess to other facilities\n•T h e  Supplemental Reserve Facility  (SRF) is not subject to explicit access\nlimits. SRF resources are provided under Stand-By or Extended Arrange-ments in addition to credit tranche or EFF resources, which are subject toannual and cumulative limits. The IMF uses the same criteria for access to itsresources under all policies and facilities (see section on “General Terms andConditions”) but in the case of the SRF also takes into account the liquidityposition of the IMF, given the magnitude of the balance of payments need incases qualifying for this facility.\n•T h e  Contingent Credit Lines  (CCLs) are not subject to access limits but\ncommitments under the CCL are expected to be in the range of 300–500 per-cent of quota. CCL resources are provided under Stand-By Arrangements, incombination with credit tranche resources up to the annual or the cumulativelimit. As with the SRF, the liquidity position of the IMF is taken into accountwhen determining access under the CCL.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n32policy measures that are considered necessary to resolve underlying balance\nof payments problems and enable members to repay the IMF within theestablished repurchase period. Phasing also enables the purchasing member\nto demonstrate to other members that its adjustment program is being\nimplemented and warrants their continued support.\nThe choice between even phasing and uneven phasing depends on the bal-\nance of payments need and the path of adjustment. These choices are made\non a case-by-case basis: resources are normally fairly evenly spread over thearrangement period but a concentration of adjustment at the beginning of\nan arrangement could justify front-loading of purchases. The frequency of\npurchases may also be affected by the length of lags in the reporting of datarelating to performance criteria.\n14\nRepurchase Policies\nThe repurchase policies of the IMF are intended to ensure the revolving\ncharacter of its resources. All purchases made from the IMF are subject topredetermined repurchase schedules (Table II.2). The length of the repur-\nchase period and the number of repurchase installments differ according to\nthe policy or facility under which the credit was extended.\nIn the case of most purchases, a borrower is expected to repurchase ear-\nlier than the schedule of repurchase obligations. Such time-based repurchase\nexpectations are aimed at securing early repayment from members in a posi-tion to do so, in keeping with a long-standing principle of the IMF that its\nresources should be used only as long as there is a balance of payments need\n(Box II.3). A waiver of early repurchase expectations can be provided bythe Executive Board upon the request of a member, if the member’s exter-\nnal position is not strong enough for the member to pay early without undue\nhardship or risk. In case of a waiver, repurchases would fall due according tothe original obligation schedule.\nTime-based repurchase expectations apply to purchases made after\nNovember 28, 2000 in the credit tranches and under the CFF and EFF. For\npurchases in the credit tranches and under the CFF, the expectation schedule\nis 1 year in advance of the obligation schedule, beginning 2¼ years after eachpurchase and ending after 4 years. For the EFF, the expectation schedule\n14Specific guidelines on phasing are set out in Selected Decisions and Selected Docu-\nments of the International Monetary Fund  (Washington). This volume is updated annually\non June 30. See, for example, the Twenty-Fifth Issue, June 30, 2000.\nTable II.2.

The basic rate of charge therefore fluctuates with the market rate for the SDR, which is \ncalculated on a weekly basis. The basic rate of charge is adjusted upward for burden sharing to \ncompensate for the overdue charges of other members (see Box II.9). The Surcharge on high levels of \ncredit outstanding under the credit tranches and the EFF is designed to discourage large use of IMF \nresources. The  SRF and CCL surcharges  increase with the time elapsed since the first SRF or CCL \npurchase, which sharpens the incentive for repurchases ahead of the obligation schedule. The annual \ncommitment fee applies to amounts available under an arrangment during the year. The fee is refunded \nto the extent that available amounts are purchased.Repurchases are made in equal installments at regular intervals over a fixed \nperiod. A member is free to repurchase in advance of maturity and to attribute \nrepurchases to any outstanding obligation to the IMF. The repurchase obligation schedule for each type of credit is generally associated with an accelerated schedule, which members are expected to follow. A member not in a position to meet the expectations schedule can request an extension up to the corresponding period in the obligation schedule.\n33\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n34BOX II.3. E VOLUTION  OF IMF P OLICIES  ON REPURCHASES\nUnder the original Articles of Agreement, there were no fixed repurchase\nperiods for the use of IMF resources: repurchases were calculated annually foreach member according to a formula based on their international reserves.\nThis reflected the principle that the IMF’s resources are made available only to\nmembers with a balance of payments and reserve need, and was designed toensure their revolving character.\nThis approach became unworkable over time, however, and was increasingly\nsupplemented by policies on repurchase periods. The coexistence of these two\napproaches—one based on explicit schedules and another on reserve\nstrength—was codified under the Second Amendment of the Articles in 1978with the establishment of fixed repurchase periods (Article V , Section 7 (c))\nand provision for early repurchase by members as their balance of paymentsand reserve position improves (Article V , Section 7 (b)).\nA major change in the repurchase policies was introduced in 1997 with the\nestablishment of the SRF to help members experiencing exceptional balance\nof payments di ff iculties owi ng to a large short- term fi nancing need resulti ngfrom a sudden and disruptive loss of market confidence. In line with the short-term nature of this type of balance of payments need, the SRF incorporatesmuch shorter repurchase periods and features repurchase expectations thatare legally outside of the framework of Article V, Section 7 (b). Repurchases\nunder the SRF are expected to be made in two installments after 1 and 1½\nyears from the date of the purchase. In order to provide flexibility for caseswhere the member’s return to capital markets takes longer than anticipated,each repurchase can be extended by up to 1 year, upon request by the memberand approval of the request by the Executive Board. The same repurchase pro-file was adopted for the CCL in 1999.\nRepurchase expectations were introduced for purchases in the credit\ntranches and under the EFF and the CFF in November 2000. These time-basedrepurchase expectations (see Table II.2) can be extended upon request by themember, in which case repurchases would fall due according to the originalo b l i g a t i o n  s c h e d u l e .  W a i v e r s  a r e  c o n s i d e r e d  b y  t h e  E x e c u t i v e  B o a r d  i f  t h emember’s external position is not strong enough for the member to pay early\nwithout undue hardship or risk. Adjustment programs supported by credit\ntranche or EFF resources are generally designed on the basis of the obligationschedule for repurchases, so that in most cases members will be in a position tomeet repurchase expectations only if their external position is stronger thanprojected at the outset of the program. In contrast, adjustment programs sup-ported by SRF and CCL resources are designed on the basis of the expectation\nschedule from repurchases.\nII General Department\n35begins after 4½ years, as with the obligation schedule, but repurchases are\ndoubled, so that the expectation schedule ends after 7 years rather than 10years under the obligation schedule. Figure II.3 illustrates the mapping of\nrepurchase expectations and the corresponding repurchase obligations.\nA member can request an extension of time-based repurchase expecta-\ntions if its external position is not sufficiently strong. If the IMF agrees to an\nextension, all repurchase expectations during the period covered by the\nextension would revert back to the corresponding repurchase obligations.There is a presumption that this period would be one year, although a longer\nor shorter period could be set. If the IMF does not agree to an extension, the\nmember would be expected to make repurchases according to the expecta-tion schedule. Failure to do so would result in a suspension of the right to\nmake further purchases, including prospective purchases under an existing\narrangement. However, the member would not be in arrears until it failed tomeet a repurchase obligation.\nIMF-supported programs are guided by the requirement that the member\nshould be able to meet repurchase obligations. In most cases, therefore, mem-bers will be considered to be in a position to meet repurchase expectations\nonly if their external position is stronger than had been projected at the time\nof approval of the associated IMF arrangement. Similarly, the evaluation ofmembers’ capacity to repay the IMF is based on the obligation schedule.\nAn early repurchase policy serves as a backstop to the standard repur-\nchase provisions. Members with IMF credit outstanding are normally\nexpected to make repurchases as their balance of payments and reserve\nposition improves.\n15 A member could experience an especially rapid and\nstrong turnaround in its balance of payments and reserve position, and maybe in a position to make repurchases earlier than under the fixed schedulesfor time-based repurchase expectations. In addition, there are some pur-chases for which time-based repurchase expectations are not applicable.\n16\nJudgments on the appropriateness of early repurchases in individual casesare made by the Executive Board. The amount of such repurchases expectedduring a given quarter is determined on the basis of a formula that reliesheavily on gross reserves (Box II.4).\n15Article V, Section 7 (b).\n16Time-based repurchase expectations do not apply to purchases made prior to Novem-\nber 2000 or to purchases under emergency assistance; separate repurchase expectationsapply to purchases under the CCL and SRF.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n36FIGURE  II.3.

E ARLY  REPURCHASE  POLICY : MINIMUM\nREPURCHASE  AMOUNTS\nFormula\nUnder the guidelines for early repurchase, the minimum amount that a\nmember is expected to repurchase each quarter is determined by a formulabased on the member’s gross international reserves:\n• 1.5 percent of latest reserves plus (minus)\n• 5.0 percent of the increase (decrease) in reserves over the previous six\nmonths.\nFor this purpose, the IMF uses the latest data on the member’s gross\nreserves as reported in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics , with gold\nvalued at SDR 35 an ounce, available when the associated financial transac-\ntions plan is prepared for Executive Board consideration. The formula thus\nensures a tight link between reserves and repayments to the IMF, with anyincrease in reserves resulting in larger repurchases and vice versa. The formulais applied anew for every quarter the member is included in the transactionsplan for early repurchases.\nLimits\nThe minimum repurchase amount is subject to quantitative limits. This\namount cannot\n• exceed 4 percent of latest reserves in a quarter,• exceed 10 percent of latest reserves in a year, or• reduce latest reserves below 250 percent of quota.\nThese limits are a means to protect members from having to draw too\nheavily on their owned reserves to meet IMF repayments. In the two decadessince the policy was established, early repurchase amounts generated by theformula have always fallen below these limits.\nCredits\nIn addition to these limits, the minimum repurchase amount is reduced to\nthe extent of any repurchase obligations falling due during the quarter or togive credit for voluntary advance repurchases:\n• in the two quarters prior to the member being included for early repur-\nchase, or\n• subsequent repurchases in excess of minimum repurchase amounts.\nThe credits are intended to encourage members to accelerate repurchases\nvoluntarily on their own terms.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n38Early repurchase expectations can arise in other contexts. Provisions for\nearly repurchase are built into the CFF, Contingent Credit Line (CCL), andSupplemental Reserve Facility (SRF). In addition, a member is required totake corrective action by making an early repurchase in the event that itmakes a purchase under an arrangement that it was not entitled to make bythe terms of the arrangement\n—that is, a noncomplying purchase. The\nrequirement of corrective action can be waived if the IMF decides that thecircumstances justify continued use of the purchased resources. A noncom-plying purchase would arise if a member were permitted to make a purchasebecause, on the basis of information available at the time, the IMF was satis-\nfied that the conditions applicable to the purchase under the arrangement\nhad been observed but, on the basis of information subsequently available, itbecame evident that the conditions of the arrangement had not actuallybeen met.\n17\nThe IMF can change the period of repurchases.18 It has the authority to\npostpone the date for the discharge of a repurchase by a majority of thevotes cast, provided that the postponement does not cause the repurchase toexceed the maximum repurchase period. Postponement beyond the maxi-\nmum period allowed under the arrangement would be considered only in\nthe event that the IMF determined that discharge on the due date wouldresult in exceptional hardship for the member and if the longer period forrepurchase is consistent with the revolving nature of the use of IMFresources. Such a decision requires approval by a 70 percent majority of thetotal voting power.\n19\nA member is free to make advance repurchases at any time. At the discre-\ntion of the member, advance repurchases can be attributed to any outstand-\ning purchases. In this way, a member is free to reduce the IMF’s holdings of\nits currency corresponding to prior purchases and thereby reduce or elimi-nate its obligation to pay interest to the IMF. Repurchases can be made, atthe choice of the repurchasing member, in SDRs or in currencies selected bythe IMF according to the policies and procedures for the use and receipt of\n17See also the discussion in Chapter V on “Measures to Deal with Misreporting.”\n18An 85 percent majority of the total voting power in the IMF is required to change the\nperiod of repurchase of holdings of currency acquired by the IMF pursuant to its policy onthe use of general resources. A 70 percent majority is required in the case of holdings of\ncurrency not acquired as a result of purchases and subject to charges under Article V , Sec-\ntion 8 (b)(ii). See Appendix II.\n19No such decision has been taken in the past 25 years.\nII General Department\n39currencies under the quarterly financial transactions plan, as discussed\nbelow under “Financial Transactions Plan.”20\nFinancial Policies and Facilities\nThe lending instruments of the IMF have evolved over the years. In its\nearly years, IMF lending took place exclusively on the basis of general poli-cies on access in what became known as the credit tranches and, in particu-\nlar, under Stand-By Arrangements. Beginning in the 1960s, special policies\nwere developed to deal with various balance of payments problems havingparticular causes, resulting over time in a multiplicity of policies on the use\nof IMF resources.\n21 Special policies on the use of IMF resources outside the\ncredit tranches are generally referred to as facilities.\nAll decisions on the extension of IMF credit are taken by the Executive\nBoard. These decisions are supported by a formal request from the member\nand an assessment by the staff of the nature and magnitude of the balance ofpayments problem, the adequacy of the policy response, and the capacity of\nthe member to repay the IMF. In 1995, the IMF specified streamlined proce-\ndures under an Emergency Financing Mechanism to allow for quicker Exec-utive Board approval of IMF financial support. This mechanism is used in\ncircumstances representing, or threatening, a crisis in a member’s external\naccounts that requires an immediate response from the IMF, as was the casein 1997 for Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand and in July 1998\nfor Russia.\nA fundamental review of IMF financial policies and facilities took place in\n2000, which resulted in a more streamlined structure, with a sharper focus on\ncrisis prevention and ensuring effective use of IMF resources. This section\ndescribes the current structure of policies and facilities; earlier lendinginstruments are noted in Box II.5.\n20Members have the option of combining all repurchases due within a calendar month,\nprovided that the combined repurchase is completed not later than the last day of the\nmonth and that no single repurchase remains outstanding for a period exceeding the maxi-mum permitted under the relevant policy of the IMF.\n21A comprehensive discussion of the evolution of IMF lending instruments is available\non the web: “Review of Facilities—Preliminary Considerations,” www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/fac/2000/index.htm.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n40Credit Tranche Policies\nFrom its early history, IMF credit was made available in tranches (seg-\nments). Members could make purchases in four credit tranches, each equiva-\nlent to 25 percent of quota, within the prevailing annual access limit of 25percent of quota and the cumulative access limit of 100 percent of quota. ABOX II.5. E ARLIER  IMF L ENDING  INSTRUMENTS\nOver the years, the IMF has established a number of policies and facilities to\nmeet particular balance of payments needs that were eventually either elimi-\nnated or allowed to lapse:\n•T h e  Buffer Stock Financing Facility , created in 1969 and eliminated in\n2000, provided financing to members to help finance their contributions toapproved commodity price stabilization funds.\n•T h e  f i r s t  Oil Facility  was created in June 1974 in response to the oil price\nshock, and lapsed in December 1974. A second  Oil Facility  was created in April\n1975 to provide additional financing, and lapsed in March 1976.\n• A policy of support for debt and debt-service operations , initiated in 1989,\nwas a key element of the IMF’s response to the debt crisis. The policy proveduseful in facilitating commercial bank debt reduction but, by the late 1990s, had\noutlived its usefulness and was discontinued in 2000.\n•A n  oil import element  was added to the Compensatory Financing Facility\n(CFF) in November 1990, when oil prices rose sharply during the Middle East\nconflict. It was allowed to lapse at end-1991.\n•T h e  Systemic Transformation Facility , created in April 1993 and allowed to\nlapse in April 1995, provided support for the early stages of transition from\ncentrally planned to market economies, in relatively small amounts and with\nrelatively low conditionality.\n• The policy on currency stabilization funds  w a s  e s t a b l i s h e d  i n  1 9 9 5  a s  a\nmeans of providing additional, precautionary support under IMF arrange-\nments during the early stage of an exchange rate–based stabilization program.No member made use of the policy, and it was discontinued in 2000.\n•A  contingency element  was added to the CFF in 1988. Until its elimination\nin 2000, this instrument provided additional access under arrangements,according to prespecified calculations, in the event of unanticipated adverse\ncurrent account developments.\n•T h e  Y2K Facility  was created in September 1999 to deal with possible\nstrains resulting from the Millennium (Y2K) computer dating problem. It was\nnot used, and lapsed in March 2000.\nII General Department\n41purchase in the first credit tranche raises the use of IMF credit to no more\nthan 25 percent of quota. The three subsequent tranches are known as the\nupper credit tranches. Over time, access to IMF credit substantially above100 percent of quota under the credit tranches has been permitted; accord-ingly, the upper credit tranches now refer more generally to any use of IMF\ncredit beyond the first credit tranche. Resources drawn in the credit tranches\ncan be used to meet any balance of payments need.\nThe segmentation in terms of first and upper credit tranches underscores\nthe basic principle that the IMF requires stronger justification in terms ofpolicy understandings from the member at higher levels of IMF credit out-standing. Conditionality is the mechanism that gives the IMF the needed\nassurances. The IMF adopts a more liberal attitude in making resources\navailable in the first credit tranche than in the upper credit tranches, pro-vided that the member is making reasonable efforts to solve its balance ofpayments problems. Requests for use of IMF resources beyond the first\ncredit tranche require substantial justification for the expectation that the\nmember’s balance of payments difficulties will be resolved within a reason-able period of time.\nAccess to the upper credit tranches is normally made under Stand-By\nArrangements. These are lines of credit from the IMF under which a “mem-ber is assured that it will be able to make purchases from the General\nResources Account in accordance with the terms of the decision during a\nspecified period and up to a specified amount.”\n22 Stand-By Arrangements\nhave long been the core lending instrument of the institution. They were ini-tially intended as precautionary instruments, to be drawn on only if pay-\nments difficulties emerged, but have been used more commonly as a source\nof external financing. Stand-By Arrangements that are treated by membersas precautionary, either at the outset of the arrangement or after immediate\nfinancing constraints have eased, have again emerged following the opening\nof world capital markets.\nStand-By Arrangements typically cover a period of 1–1½ years but can be\nlonger, up to a maximum of 3 years. Performance criteria, the phasing of pur-chases, and program reviews apply to the use of IMF resources in the uppercredit tranches, but not in the first credit tranche, even under a Stand-By\nArrangement.\n23 Repurchases are expected each quarter 2¼–4 years after\n22Article XXX (b).\n23Outright purchases without IMF arrangements can take place, but are rare.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n42each purchase, but these expectations can be extended to a maximum repur-\nchase period of 3¼–5 years. In addition to the charges for the use of IMF\ncredit, members pay a commitment fee for Stand-By Arrangements, which is\nrefunded to the extent that amounts under the arrangement are purchased(Table II.2 summarizes the terms of IMF credit under the various policiesand facilities).\nExtended Fund Facility\nThe Extended Fund Facility (EFF) was established in 1974 as a vehicle for\nlonger-term external financing for members undertaking needed structuraleconomic reforms. The EFF is designed for economies:\n• suffering serious payments imbalances relating to structural maladjust-\nments in production and trade and where price and cost distortionshave been widespread, or\n• characterized by slow growth and an inherently weak balance of pay-\nments position, which prevent pursuit of an active development policy.\nThe EFF is especially appropriate for members graduating from the Pov-\nerty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) programs or transition econo-mies that lack adequate capital market access. At the same time, the EFFand all other IMF facilities are available in principle to any member that\nmeets the eligibility criteria.\nMembers drawing under the EFF do so in the context of an Extended\nArrangement. These are three-year IMF arrangements, which can be\nextended for a fourth year. Performance criteria and purchases typically fol-\nlow a semiannual schedule. Repurchases are also made semiannually, andover a longer period than applies to the credit tranches: repurchases areexpected 4½–7 years after each purchase but this can be extended to themaximum repurchase period of 4½–10 years. Members pay a refundable\ncommitment fee for Extended Arrangements, as well as the applicable\ncharges for the use of IMF credit.\nSupplemental Reserve Facility\nThe Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) was established at the end of\n1997, at the height of the Asian financial crisis. Its purpose is to provide\nfinancial assistance to members experiencing exceptional balance of pay-ments difficulties due to a large, short-term financing need following a sud-den and disruptive loss of confidence reflected in pressure on the capitalaccount and the member’s foreign reserves. Access under the SRF is separate\nII General Department\n43from the limits that apply to the credit tranches and the EFF, and it has no\nexplicit limits of its own. SRF resources are provided under Stand-By or\nExtended Arrangements. The conditionality in an arrangement involvingSRF resources is that of the associated Stand-By or Extended Arrangement.\nThe repurchase period for SRF resources is much shorter than that gov-\nerning the credit tranches and EFF, reflecting the likelihood of a quickerturnaround in the balance of payments. Repurchases are made in twoinstallments and are expected 1–1½ years after each purchase; this period\ncan be extended up to the maximum repurchase period of 2–2½ years.Resources drawn under the SRF are subject to the basic rate of chargeapplying to all IMF credit and a specific surcharge. During the first yearfrom the date of the first purchase under the facility, the SRF surcharge is setat 300 basis points, and it rises by 50 basis points at the end of the first yearand every six months thereafter, up to a maximum of 500 basis points. Thestandard commitment fee for Stand-By Arrangements applies.\nContingent Credit Lines\nThe Contingent Credit Line (CCL) is a new type of lending instrument for\nthe IMF. Conceived in the midst of a series of severe financial crises involv-\ning large-scale use of IMF resources by a number of members, the CCL wasestablished by the IMF in 1999 as a means of preventing the spread of capi-tal account–driven crises. The CCL is intended to provide members main-\ntaining strong policies with a precautionary line of defense against balanceof payments problems arising from international financial contagion.Although it draws on IMF experience over several decades, the CCL has anumber of novel features that set it apart from other IMF lending instru-ments, notably an element of pre-qualification and automaticity in usingIMF resources.\nThe CCL is subject to demanding eligibility requirements:\n• the absence of an immediate need to use IMF resources at the time of\napproval;\n• a positive assessment of policies by the IMF, taking into account the\nmember’s adherence to internationally accepted standards (especiallythe IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard or SDDS);\n• constructive relations with private creditors, with a view to facilitating\nappropriate involvement of the private sector, and satisfactory manage-ment of external vulnerability; and\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n44• a satisfactory economic and financial program, which the member\nstands ready to adjust as needed.\nAs with the SRF, CCL resources are provided under Stand-By Arrange-\nments, in combination with credit tranche resources. Access to CCL resources\nis expected to be in the range of 300–500 percent of quota, and does not count\ntoward the access limits for the credit tranches and the EFF.\nUpon approval of an arrangement with CCL resources, a small amount is\nmade available but is not expected to be purchased. If a crisis strikes, the\nmember may request the completion of an activation review, at which the\nExecutive Board would ascertain that the member is affected by a crisis\nstemming from contagion and that the member’s own policies had not been\na significant cause of the pressures in its balance of payments. There is a pre-\nsumption that one-third of the amount committed under the CCL would be\nreleased at this time. The phasing and conditionality for the remaining CCL\nresources would be specified in a post-activation review concluded shortly\nafter or together with the activation review; conditionality would be\nexpected to cover macroeconomic rather than structural policies, given thenature of the balance of payments difficulties.\nThe financial terms for CCL resources are identical to those governing\nSRF resources, except that the surcharge on CCL resources over the basic\nrate of charge is 150 basis points lower: the CCL surcharge is 150 basis\npoints initially, rising by 50 basis points one year after the first purchase and\nevery six months thereafter, up to a maximum surcharge of 350 basis points.\nThe commitment fee for the CCL is the same as for the SRF.\nCompensatory Financing Facility\nThe CFF was the first facility aimed at helping members deal with special\nbalance of payments problems. It was established in the 1960s to ensure\ntimely external financing for members experiencing balance of payments\ndifficulties resulting from a temporary decline in export earnings. A cereal\nimport element was added in 1981; two other elements introduced since the\nestablishment of the CFF have been removed (see Box II.5). In addition to\nhaving a balance of payments need related to export shortfalls or excess\ncereal import costs, the eligibility requirements include the following:\n• the export shortfall or excess cereal import cost are of a short-term\ncharacter;\n• the shortfall or excess must be largely attributable to factors beyond the\nmember’s control; and\nII General Department\n45• if the member has balance of payments difficulties beyond the effect of\nthe shortfall or excess, it must have a new or existing arrangement inplace at the time of the request for a CFF purchase.\nAccess under the CFF is subject to its own limits, and does not count\ntoward the access limits under the credit tranches and the EFF. The CFFaccess limits range from 45 percent of quota for each of the export shortfall\nand excess cereal import costs elements to a combined limit of 55 percent of\nquota. Within these limits, actual access is determined by the size of theshortfall or excess, and may be limited by concerns about the member’s abil-\nity to repay the IMF. Access under the CFF counts toward the threshold for\nupper credit tranche conditionality\n—that is, the CFF does not “float” as\nregards conditionality.24\nUnder certain circumstances, purchases under the CFF may be phased,\nwith purchases subsequent to the initial purchase being conditioned on themember’s having an IMF arrangement in place and meeting all the condi-\ntions for a purchase or disbursement under that arrangement. They are sub-\nject to the same terms as credit tranche resources with respect to charges,repurchase expectations, and repurchase obligations; CFF purchases do not\ncarry a surcharge, however, and do not count toward the calculation of sur-\ncharges applying to IMF credit outstanding in excess of 200 percent ofquota.\nIn addition to the time-based early repurchase expectations, the CFF\nincorporates additional specific early repurchase provisions. If a membermakes a purchase on the basis of estimated data for the shortfall in export\nearnings or excess in cereal import costs, and if the actual data, once they are\navailable, indicate that the purchase exceeded the amount that would havebeen available had actual data been used, the member is expected to repur-\nchase promptly an amount equivalent to the difference.\nEmergency Assistance\nThe IMF has a long-standing policy of providing financial assistance to\nmembers experiencing emergencies. The conditionality associated with IMF\nlending for this purpose is similar to that required for purchases in the first\n24In practice, this means that a member with 25 percent of quota or more of credit out-\nstanding under the CFF cannot access the credit tranches with first credit tranche (lower)conditionality.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n46credit tranche. Two basic types of emergencies are covered by this policy:\nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes; and post-\nconflict situations, following social disruptions.\nEmergency assistance for natural disasters is available where the member\ncannot meet its immediate financing needs arising from a natural disaster\nwithout serious depletion of its foreign reserves. If this exigency were not\npresent, however, IMF assistance for these members could be provided\nunder the CFF or a Stand-By or an Extended Arrangement. The policy con-\nditions include a statement of the general policies the member intends to\npursue, and some assurance that the member will cooperate with the IMF in\nan effort to find, where appropriate, solutions for its balance of payments\ndifficulties.\nIn post-conflict situations, emergency assistance can be made available\nwhere there is an urgent balance of payments need and a role for the IMF in\ncatalyzing support from others, but where the institutional and administra-\ntive capacity of the member has been disrupted as a result of social conflict,\nso that the member is not yet able to develop and implement a comprehen-\nsive economic program that could be supported by an IMF arrangement. In\nthese circumstances, there must nevertheless be sufficient capacity for plan-\nning and policy implementation and a demonstrated commitment by the\nauthorities. Support from the IMF in these cases must be part of a concerted\ninternational effort to address the aftermath of the conflict situation in a\ncomprehensive way.\nIMF assistance in emergency situations was initially provided through the\nflexible application of policies on the use of the credit tranches, but since 2000\nhas been subject to a special policy outside the credit tranches. Access is nor-\nmally limited to 25 percent of quota. Larger amounts can be made available\non an exceptional basis: a further 25 percent of quota can be provided in post-\nconflict situations where progress on capacity rebuilding has been slow andthe member is not in a position to move to an IMF arrangement after one year\nbut where there is sufficient evidence of the authorities’ commitment to\nreform and capacity to implement policies; tranching of disbursements may be\nappropriate in these cases. Purchases under emergency assistance are subject\nto the basic rate of charge and a maximum repurchase period of 3¼–5 years,\nbut are not subject to time-based repurchase expectations and do not count\ntoward the calculation of the surcharge on IMF credit in excess of 200 percent\nof quota. The IMF has set up a special administered account with the purpose\nof providing PRGF-eligible countries with post-conflict emergency assistance\nII General Department\n47at the concessional rate of interest of ½ of 1 percent a year (see Appendix III.)\nTo achieve this objective, adequate donor resources will need to be mobilized.\nThe amounts of IMF credit outstanding by facility during 1990–2000 are\nshown in Figure II.4.\nCurrency Holdings\nIn the balance sheet of the GRA, the IMF distinguishes between usable\ncurrencies and other currencies. Usable currencies comprise the currencies\nof those member countries that have a sufficiently strong balance of pay-ments and reserve positions for their currencies to be used to provide creditto other members. These currency holdings represent the bulk of resources\navailable to meet the future demand for IMF credit. Other currencies\ninclude the currencies of members with weaker external positions that arenot being used for credit purposes, although they could become usable if themembers’ balance of payments positions improved, and the currencies of\nborrowers.\nValuation of Currencies\nCurrencies and securities held in the GRA’s pool of resources are valued\nin terms of the SDR on the basis of each member’s representative rate of\nexchange. Each member is obligated to maintain, in SDR terms, the value ofthe balances of the IMF’s holdings of its currency in the GRA, but not thoseheld elsewhere by the IMF, such as in the SDA or the Administered\nAccounts.\n25 The total SDR value of the IMF’s holdings of currencies in the\nGRA is kept constant through changes to the amount of members’ currencybalances. A member has to pay in additional currency if its currency depreci-ates against the SDR, and the IMF will refund some of these currency hold-ings if the currency appreciates. This requirement is referred to as the\nmaintenance-of-value obligation. Because of this obligation the IMF’s\nresources are insulated from exchange rate fluctuations.\nA member’s currency held by the IMF is revalued in SDR terms whenever:\n• the currency is used by the IMF in a transaction with another member,\n• at the end of the IMF’s financial year (April 30),\n25Revaluation changes in members’ currencies in relation to the SDR in the other IMF\naccounts (the SDA and the Administered Accounts) are reported as valuation gains andlosses for those accounts.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n48 FIGURE  II.4.

All holdings of a member’s currency in the\nGRA, including any unsettled obligations resulting from an earlier revalua-tion, are revalued at the new rate. The new rate is applied to all transactionsin that currency, including administrative receipts and payments, until such atime as the rate may again need to be adjusted.\nThe currency valuation adjustments are part of the IMF’s holdings of\nmembers’ currencies. Whenever the IMF revalues its holdings of a member’s\ncurrency, reflecting a change in its exchange rate with the SDR, an accountreceivable or an account payable is established for the amount of currencypayable by or to the member in order to maintain the value of holdings ofthe member’s currency in terms of the SDR.\nSDR Holdings\nThe IMF does not receive allocations of SDRs, but obtains its SDRs as\npayment of the reserve asset portion of quota subscriptions and in settle-\nment of charges and, to a lesser degree, repayment of credit. The IMF, in\nturn, uses these SDRs to pay interest on creditor positions and to providecredit to members. Since SDRs were created as a supplement to existing\nreserve assets, the IMF does not maintain large holdings of SDRs for long\nperiods of time, but rather recirculates the SDRs it receives back to themembership. The SDR system, and the key role of the GRA in the circula-\ntion of SDRs, is discussed in Chapter III.\nGold Holdings\nThe IMF holds 103 million fine (troy) ounces (3,217 metric tons) of gold at\ndesignated official depositories, making it the third largest official holder of\ngold after the United States and Germany. IMF holdings account for about\n10 percent of total official gold stocks. The IMF acquired its gold in variousways (Box II.6). The IMF’s gold holdings are valued on its balance sheet on\nthe basis of historical cost, with a book value of SDR 5.9 billion. Valued at\nend-April 2001 market prices, the IMF’s holdings amount to over SDR 21billion (about $27 billion).\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n50BOX II.6. S OURCES  AND  USES OF THE IMF’ S GOLD\nThe IMF acquired virtually all its gold holdings through four main types of\ntransactions under the pre-Second Amendment (1978) Articles of Agreement.\n•Subscriptions . The original Articles of Agreement prescribed that 25 per-\ncent of initial subscriptions and quota increases was normally to be paid ingold. This represented the largest source of the IMF’s gold.\n•Payment of charges . Originally, all charges, or interest, on members’ out-\nstanding use of IMF credit were normally payable in gold.\n•Repurchases . Members could use gold to repay the IMF for credit previ-\nously extended.\n•Purchases . A member wishing to obtain the currency of another member\ncould acquire it by selling gold to the IMF. The major use of this provision wassales of gold to the IMF by South Africa in 1970–71.\nOutf lows of  gold f rom the IMF’ s hol di ngs occurred under the pre-Second\nAmendment (1978) Articles of Agreement through sales of gold for currency,and via payment of remuneration and interest. Sales of gold for currency wereas follows:\n•Sales for replenishment (1957–70) . In the late 1950s and in the 1960s, the\nIMF sold gold on several occasions to replenish its holdings of currencies.\n•South African gold and mitigation . In the early 1970s, the IMF sold gold to\nmembers in amounts roughly corresponding to the amounts purchased earlierfrom South Africa; it also sold gold in connection with payments of gold forquota increases by some members, in order to mitigate the impact of these pay-ments on the gold holdings of reserve centers.\n•Investment in U.S. Government securities (1956–72) . In order to generate\nincome to offset operational deficits, some gold was sold to the United Statesand the proceeds invested in U.S. Government securities. A significant buildupof reserves through income from charges prompted the IMF to reacquire thisgold from the U.S. Government in the early 1970s.\n•Auctions and “restitution” sales (1976–80) . The IMF sold approximately\none-third (50 million ounces) of its then-existing gold holdings following anagreement by its members to reduce the role of gold in the international mon-etary system. Half of this amount was sold in restitution to members at thethen-official price of SDR 35 an ounce; the other half was auctioned to themarket to finance the Trust Fund, which supported concessional lending by theIMF to low-income countries.\nSince 1980, the IMF has had few transactions in gold. A very small amount of\ngold was received from Cambodia in 1992 in discharge of its overdue obligations.In 1993, the IMF pledged to sell up to 3 million ounces of gold if the resources ofthe PRGF Trust Reserve Account were insufficient to cover repayments toPRGF creditors resulting from loans made to encash rights under the rightsaccumulation approach. Finally, during 1999–2000, the IMF conducted a seriesof off-market transactions in gold that left its gold holdings unchanged, in orderto generate resources to help finance its participation in the HIPC Initiative.\nII General Department\n51Gold in the Articles of Agreement\nBefore the Second Amendment of the Articles in April 1978, the role of\ngold in the IMF and in the international monetary system was central andpervasive. The Second Amendment contained a number of provisions that,in combination, were intended to achieve a gradual reduction of the role ofgold in the international monetary system and in the IMF. The Second\nAmendment:\n• eliminated the use of gold as the common denominator of the par value\nsystem and as the basis of the value of the SDR;\n• abolished the official price of gold and abolished the obligatory uses of\ngold in transactions between the IMF and its members;\n• required the IMF, in its dealings in gold, to avoid managing its price or\nestablishing a fixed price of gold; and\n• included an undertaking by members to collaborate with the IMF and\nother members with respect to reserve assets to promote better interna-tional surveillance of international liquidity.\nThe Articles now limit the use of gold in the IMF’s transactions. Any\ntransactions in gold by the IMF require a decision by an 85 percent majority\nof the total voting power in the IMF. The IMF:\n• may sell gold outright on the basis of prevailing market prices;• may accept gold in the discharge of a member’s obligations to the IMF\nat an agreed price on the basis of prices in the market at the time of\nacceptance;\n• does not have the authority to engage in any other gold transactions,\nfor example, loans, leases, swaps, or use of gold as collateral; and\n• does not have the authority to buy gold.\nThe IMF’s Policy on Gold\nThe IMF’s policies on gold are governed by the following five principles:\n• As an undervalued asset held by the IMF, gold provides fundamental\nstrength to its balance sheet. Any mobilization of IMF gold should\navoid weakening its overall financial position.\n• Gold holdings provide the IMF with operational maneuverability both\nas regards the use of its resources and through adding credibility to its\nprecautionary balances. In these respects, the benefits of the IMF’s gold\nholdings are passed on to the membership at large, including both cred-\nitors and debtors.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n52• The IMF should continue to hold a relatively large amount of gold\namong its assets, not only for prudential reasons, but also to meetunforeseen contingencies.\n• The IMF has a systemic responsibility to avoid causing disruptions to\nthe functioning of the gold market.\n• Profits from any gold sales should be retained in an investment fund,\nand only the investment income should be used for any purposes thatmay be agreed upon by the IMF members.\nThe IMF’s Gold Since 1980\nUses of the IMF’s gold have occurred on two occasions since 1980 without\nchanging the IMF’s long-term holdings of gold. As was the case with the\nopen-market auctions of gold in 1976–80, these uses of gold were for thebenefit of the poorest members of the IMF. Toward this end, the IMFpledged gold in 1993 and decided in 1999 to conduct off-market transactionsof gold.\nGold Pledge\nTo reassure creditors to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility\n(ESAF) that they would be repaid for ESAF (now PRGF) loans made toencash rights under the “rights accumulation approach,” it was agreed, if\nnecessary, to mobilize some of the IMF’s gold. For this purpose, in 1993 the\nIMF decided\n—with the required 85 percent majority of the total voting\npower —to sell up to 3 million ounces of gold if it were determined that the\nresources in the PRGF Trust Reserve Account (plus other available meansof financing) were insufficient to meet payments to be made from that\naccount to PRGF creditors. The shortfall would be covered by gold sales to\nthe extent of previous drawings on the Reserve Account attributable tooverdue repayments by borrowers of loans for the encashment of rights, plusthe interest earnings forgone on such drawings.\nIt is difficult to assess the likelihood that the gold pledge for rights encash-\nments under PRGF arrangements would be drawn on in the future, mainlybecause of uncertainty about future borrowings under the rights approach.Sierra Leone and Zambia still have loans outstanding to the PRGF Trustunder the rights approach, but these loans are rapidly diminishing either\nbecause they are coming close to maturity or because they are covered under\nthe enhanced HIPC Initiative. It is, therefore, highly unlikely that the gold\nII General Department\n53pledge would be activated in connection with these loans. Moreover, the\ngold pledge could not be called upon until after the resources of the ReserveAccount of the PRGF Trust were exhausted.\n26 Nevertheless, three coun-\ntries—Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan —remain eligible for the rights\napproach and could conceivably borrow sizable sums from the PRGF in con-nection with rights encashments at some time in the future, provided the\nExecutive Board continues to extend the availability of the rights approach.\nWhether these countries will follow the rights approach to arrears clearanceis uncertain. In any case, the earliest rights encashments could not take place\nfor a few years and repayment of those PRGF loans would only commence\nfive and half years after such disbursements.\nOff-Market Transactions in Gold\nTo help finance its contribution to the HIPC Initiative, the IMF in 1999–\n2000 conducted a series of off-market transactions in gold. During December1999–April 2000, the IMF sold a total of 12.944 million fine ounces of gold toBrazil and Mexico at the prevailing market price on the day of each transac-tion. The total amount sold was equivalent to SDR 2.7 billion ($3.7 billion).After each sale, the gold was immediately accepted back by the IMF at thesame price in settlement of financial obligations of these members to theIMF. The net effect of these transactions left the IMF’s holdings of physical\ngold unchanged, but the gold accepted back was included in the IMF’s bal-ance sheet at the market price of the transactions, instead of at the originalprice of SDR 35 a fine ounce.\nIn accordance with the Articles, the equivalent of SDR 35 a fine ounce\nfrom the proceeds of the sales was retained in the GRA. The proceeds inexcess of this amount (totaling SDR 2.2 billion, or about $2.9 billion) areheld in the SDA and invested. The income from these investments, whichwill be transferred to the PRGF-HIPC Trust when needed, will be used tohelp finance the IMF’s contribution to the HIPC Initiative. In this context,the Board of Governors of the IMF adopted a resolution in September 1999stating that the off-market gold transactions would “be a one-time operationof a highly exceptional nature.”\nThese gold transactions affected the IMF’s balance sheet and income as\nfollows:\n26The Reserve Account of the PRGF Trust is discussed in Chapter IV.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n54• The IMF’s holdings of usable currencies in the GRA were lower, and\nreserve tranche positions higher, than they would otherwise have beenby the amount of profit (SDR 2.2 billion). This is because Brazil andMexico paid in gold instead of usable currencies, which would havebeen used to reduce reserve tranche positions of creditor members.\n• The IMF’s net income is affected by the remuneration expense on the\ncontinuing enlarged reserve tranche positions. The additional remuner-ation expense varies with the rate of remuneration, and amounted to anestimated SDR 94 million in FY2001. For comparison, the IMF’s netincome target for FY2001, the first year in which the full income effectof the off-market gold transactions was felt, was SDR 48 million, andfor FY2002 net income is targeted at SDR 51 million.\nWhile the transactions were successful in that they allowed the IMF to\ncontribute to the resolution of the debt problems of the HIPCs, theyresulted in an increase in the IMF’s cost of operations. Since, under standardprocedures (see the discussion of “Operational Income” below), this rela-\ntively large increase in cost would have resulted in a higher rate of charge,the cost increase was mitigated or offset through the existing burden-sharingmechanism and placed in the SCA-1. In the same way, SDR 94 million isbeing generated in FY2002.\nQuotas\nEach member of the IMF is assigned a quota and pays a capital subscrip-\ntion to the IMF that is equal to its quota. As noted earlier, a quarter of a\nmember’s quota subscription is normally paid in reserve assets, with theremainder paid in the member’s own currency.\n27 Quotas are expressed in\nSDRs and their size is determined by the IMF’s Board of Governors,broadly on the basis of the economic size of the country, and taking intoaccount quotas of similar countries. To help in this determination, five for-\nmulas are used that relate the quota to the size of the country’s GDP , current\naccount transactions, and official reserves. As of April 30, 2001, total quotas\n27The IMF has made arrangements to assist members with insufficient reserves to pay\nthe reserve asset portion of their quota subscription payment through a same-day, no-costIMF lending operation (see Chapter III, Box III.4).The Resource and Liability Side\nII General Department\n55of all members amounted to SDR 212.4 billion. A list of members and their\nquotas is provided in Appendix I.\nMembers’ quotas constitute the financial base of the IMF and determine\nits size, as well as serve other functions as determined by the IMF’s Articles.\n• Quotas provide the vast bulk of reserve assets that can be used in the\nprovision of foreign reserves by the IMF, despite the availability of bor-\nrowed resources and the growing role of administered resources to pro-\nvide concessional assistance to the IMF’s poorest members.\n• Quotas determine the distribution of voting power in the IMF.28 Quo-\ntas determine members’ financial relationships with the IMF and,through the effect on voting power, members’ roles in IMF decision-\nmaking and representation on the Executive Board. Many decisions are\ntaken by a simple majority vote, though special voting majorities are\nrequired for some important financial decisions (Appendix II).\n• Quotas continue to play a crucial role in determining the demand for\nIMF resources. Quotas serve as the basis for access to such resources in\nthe great majority of IMF-supported programs, subject to limits set by theArticles and the Executive Board.\n29 Over the years, however, the rela-\ntionship between quotas and access has become more elastic, especially\nas the demand for IMF resources has become more unpredictable\nbecause of the increased role of capital flows in balance of payments dise-\nquilibria. Waivers of the Articles’ limits on access to IMF resources havebeen granted where necessary to allow access in line with operational\nrequirements.\n• Quotas also determine a member’s share in a general allocation of\nSDRs.\n30\nThe initial quotas of the original members of the IMF were determined at\nthe Bretton Woods conference in 1944 (Schedule A of the IMF Articles);\nthose of subsequent members have been determined by the IMF’s Board of\n28A member’s voting power is equal to 250 basic votes plus one additional vote for each\nSDR 100,000 in quota. Basic votes therefore help to strengthen the relative voting power\nof members with smaller quotas. \n29While the IMF’s holdings of a member’s currency, which measure its access to IMF\ncredit, are restricted to no more than 200 percent of quota under the Articles (Article V ,\nSection 3 (b)(iii)), this limit—which amounts to IMF credit of 100 percent of quota—is rou-\ntinely waived. See the discussion of “Access Policy” above.\n30Article XVIII, Section 2 (b).\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n56Governors, based on principles consistent with those applied to existing\nmembers. The IMF has adjusted quotas within the context of five-yearly\ngeneral reviews and on an ad hoc basis outside of general reviews. An\n85 percent majority of voting power is needed to change quotas.\nThe determination of the quota of a new member of the IMF is based on\nthe principle that a member’s quota should be in the same range as the quo-\ntas of existing members of comparable economic size and characteristics.Operationally, this principle has been applied through the use of quota for-\nmulas. Since the IMF’s inception, the calculated quotas derived from the\nquota formulas have been used to help guide decisions regarding the sizeand distribution of members’ actual quotas.\nQuota formulas have evolved over time starting from the formula\n—contain-\ning national income, official reserves, imports, export variability, and the ratio ofexports to national income\n—that was devised at Bretton Woods in 1944 to give\nsupport to the broad configuration of initial quotas that was being negotiated.\nA multiformula approach was adopted in the early 1960s, when the Bret-\nton Woods formula was revised and supplemented by four other formulas\ncontaining the same basic variables but with larger weights for external\ntrade and export variability. The Bretton Woods formula, with its relativelyhigh weight for national income, has generally favored large economies,\nwhile the additional four formulas have tended to produce higher quotas\nthan the Bretton Woods formula for smaller, more open economies. The fiveformulas, which are listed in Box II.7, were last modified in 1982–83.\nGeneral Reviews\nThe IMF conducts general reviews of all members’ quotas normally at five\nyear intervals.31 Such reviews allow the IMF to assess the adequacy of quo-\ntas in terms of members’ needs for conditional liquidity and the IMF’s abil-\nity to finance those needs. A general review also allows for adjustments ofmembers’ quotas to reflect changes in their relative positions in the world\neconomy. Of the general reviews conducted to date, only one (in 1958/59)\nwas outside the five-year cycle.\nT h e  ma i n  i s s u e s  a d d r e s s e d  i n  g e n e r a l  q u o t a  r e v i e w s  a r e  t h e  s i z e  o f  a n\noverall increase in quotas and the distribution of the increase among the\n31Article III, Section 2 (a).\nII General Department\n57BOX II.7. T HE PRESENT  FIVE QUOTA  FORMULAS\nThe present five quota formulas, with the Bretton Woods formula listed\nfirst, are:\nCQ = (0.01 Y + 0.025 R + 0.05 P + 0.2276 VC)(1 + C/Y),\nCQ = (0.0065 Y + 0.0205125 R + 0.078P + 0.4052 VC)(1 + C/Y),\nCQ = (0.0045 Y + 0.03896768 R + 0.07 P + 0.76976 VC)(1 + C/Y),\nCQ = 0.005 Y + 0.042280464 R + 0.044 ( P + C) + 0.8352 VC,\nCQ = 0.0045 Y + 0.05281008 R + 0.039 ( P + C) + 1.0432 VC,\nwhere CQ = calculated quota;\n Y = GDP at current market prices for a recent year;\n R = twelve-month average of gold and foreign exchange\nreserves, including SDR holdings and reserve positions\nin the IMF, for a recent year;\n P = annual average of current payments (goods, services,\nincome, and private transfers) for a recentfive-year period;\n C = annual average of current receipts (goods, services,\nincome, and private transfers) for a recent five-yearperiod; and\n VC = variability of current receipts, defined as one standard\ndeviation from the five-year moving average centeredon the third year, for a recent 13-year period.\nFor each of the four non–Bretton Woods formulas, quota calculations are\nmultiplied by an adjustment factor so that the sum of the calculations acrossmembers equals that derived from the Bretton Woods formula. The calcu-lated quota of a member is the higher of the Bretton Woods calculation orthe average of the lowest two of the remaining four calculations (afteradjustment).\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n58members. Four reviews concluded that no increase in quotas was needed. In\nthe other eight reviews, the overall quota increase ranged from 31 percent to61 percent (Tables II.3 and II.4).\nIncreases in members’ quotas during general reviews typically consist of\ntwo elements: (1) an equiproportional element which is distributed to all\nmembers according to their existing quota shares; and (2) a selective ele-\nment which is distributed to either all members or a subset of members. Theselective element is used to attain a change in quota shares among members.For any overall increase in quotas, the larger the selective increase, thegreater the redistribution of quota shares. In practice, the selective compo-nent has tended to be relatively small.\nBoth the list of members eligible for a selective increase and the way of dis-\ntributing the selective element are based on the Executive Board’s judgment.\nThe distribution of selective quota increases have generally been based oncalculated quotas.\n32 Calculated quotas are determined by the quota formulas,\nwhich have been designed to provide a quantified measure of a country’s rela-tive economic position.\n33 The following examples illustrate the methods used.\n• During the Sixth Review in 1976, the Executive Board decided to dou-\nble the quota share of the major oil exporters with the stipulation thatthe collective share of all the developing countries should not fall. Thedecision was based on the judgment that such a reallocation wouldstrengthen the IMF’s liquidity. In this instance, the quota formulasplayed no role in identifying the members eligible for the selective\nincrease.\n• Under the Eleventh Review in 1998, 25 percent of the quota increase\nwas selective. The quota formulas helped determine each member’sshare of the selective increase as follows: (1) 15 percent of the totalincrease (three-fifths of the selective element) was distributed to allmembers; (2) in addition, 10 percent of the total increase was distributed\n32Since the Eighth Review in 1982/83, all members have received an increase comprised\nof an equiproportional element and a selective element that reflected a member’s share incalculated quotas.\n33As further explained below, formulas are one element in determining actual quotas. While\nquota formulas are not mentioned in the Articles, and the Executive Board has not formally\nadopted any formula, the Board has usually relied on them as an independent measure ofmembers’ relative economic position in the world economy. Typically, the quota resulting from\nthe formulas—the calculated quota—is different from the actual quota of a member and, in\nthe most recent review, actual quotas were on average less than half of calculated quotas.\nII General Department\n59TABLE  II.3.

This reflects the fact that it has been easier to reach\nagreement if all members receive an increase in quotas. Agreement is more\ndifficult to reach when only a subset of members receives an increase, as thequotas of all other members would remain unchanged and their quotashares would decline.\nAd Hoc Increases\nA member can request an adjustment of its quota at any time.35 Ad hoc\nquota increases can occur both within and outside the context of a general\nreview. In recent years, they have tended to occur within a general review.\nAs with selective increases, both the quota formulas and the ExecutiveBoard’s judgment have played a role in determining the amount of the adhoc adjustment. The following are examples.\n• Five members (France, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Paraguay,\nand the Philippines) received ad hoc increases between 1947 and 1959.\nThe main factor underlying these increases was the view that the initialquotas of these members at the time of the Bretton Woods conference in1945 had been set at unduly low levels. Between 1959 and 1969, the quo-\ntas of another nine countries were adjusted on an ad hoc basis. All of the\nforegoing increases occurred outside the context of a general review.\n• Japan received an ad hoc increase under the Ninth Review. In this case,\nthe seven largest industrial countries agreed to redistribute quotaincreases among themselves in such a manner that the quota increasesfor the rest of the membership were not affected.\n36\n34“Out of line” was defined as those countries with ratios of calculated to actual quotas\nabove one. Thirty-eight members met this criterion. Five of these members, whose quotaswere farthest out of line and which were able to contribute to the IMF’s liquidity over the\nmedium term, received 1 percent of the 10 percent share going to the group of 38 members.\n35Under Article III, Section 2 (a), the IMF may, “if it thinks fit, consider at any other\ntime the adjustment of any particular quota at the request of the member concerned.”\n36As a result of this redistribution to accommodate an ad hoc increase in the quota of\nJapan, the new quotas for Germany and Japan were equalized, as were the quotas of\nFrance and the United Kingdom (ranked just below those of Japan and Germany), and\nadjustments were made to the quotas of the United States, Canada, and Italy so that thetotal quotas for the seven countries as a group was maintained unchanged.\nII General Department\n63Since 1970, there have been only four ad hoc increases in quotas outside\nthe framework of a general review. Ad hoc increases in the quotas of China\nin 1980 and of Cambodia in 1994 were associated with the change in repre-\nsentation of the member in the IMF (China) and the resumption of activerelations with the IMF (Cambodia), as China’s initial quota had never been\nincreased and Cambodia’s quota had not been increased since 1970. SaudiArabia received an ad hoc increase in 1981. A major factor underlying SaudiArabia’s ad hoc increase was the desire to strengthen the IMF’s liquidity\nposition during the developing country debt crisis before the Eighth Review\nhad been completed. China also received an ad hoc quota increase in 2001 tobetter reflect its position in the world economy following its resumption ofexercising sovereignty over Hong Kong. For each of the post-1969 cases, thequota formulas played a role in determining the extent of the ad hocincrease.\nRole of the Quota Formulas\nIn practice, the role of the quota formulas in determining actual quotas\nand quota share adjustments has been quite limited. As noted above, quota\nincreases in the context of general reviews have been distributed largely onthe basis of a uniform proportionate increase in actual quotas. The continu-ing significant difference between actual and calculated quota sharesreflects:\n• the Executive Board’s view that general quota reviews should provide\nall members with an adequate increase in quota;\n• a general reluctance to make politically difficult quota share adjust-\nments; and\n• widespread dissatisfaction with formulas that were viewed as overly\ncomplex, lacking in transparency, and not representative of actual con-ditions in the world economy.\nIn 1999, the IMF established an external panel of independent experts, the\nQuota Formula Review Group (QFRG), to assess the adequacy of the for-\nmulas used to guide the determination of quotas and to make recommenda-tions for reforms that would take account of changes in the world economyand the international financial system and the increasing globalization ofmarkets. The eight member panel, chaired by Professor Richard Cooper ofHarvard University, submitted a report that was considered by the Executive\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n64Board, along with a staff commentary, in August 2000. The report and staff\ncommentary were subsequently published on the IMF’s website.37\nThe QFRG report provided information about the history and operation\nof the quota formulas, suggested guiding principles for future reforms, and\npresented recommendations to simplify and update the formulas. The Exec-\nutive Board discussion revealed a wide range of views on the issues raised inthe report and the staff commentary. There was general recognition of theneed to simplify the present formulas and to update them to take account of\nthe growing role of capital flows. However, concern was expressed that a\npreliminary partial quantification of the formula recommended by the panelpointed toward a greater concentration of quotas among the largest indus-\ntrial countries (subsequently confirmed by more complete and updated staff\ncalculations).\n38 Executive Directors agreed on the need to carry forward the\nwork of the external panel with a view to developing quota formulas thatmore fully reflect members’ roles in the world economy. The International\nMonetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) supported this view at their\nmeeting in Prague in September 2001, and a work program has beenadopted to further consider alternative quota formulas prior to the 2001Annual Meetings.\nReserve Tranche Positions\nIn making the reserve asset portion of their quota payment, members\nacquire a liquid claim on the IMF in exchange for the reserves they provide,\nmuch like a demand deposit in a commercial bank. This claim is called thereserve tranche position; it is equal to the member’s quota less the IMF’s\nholdings of the member’s currency in the GRA (excluding currency holdings\nthat stem from the member’s own use of credit). The share of a member’ssubscription maintained in reserve assets varies over time from its initiallevel of some 25 percent at the time of quota payment. A member’s reserve\ntranche position increases when the IMF uses its currency to lend to other\nmembers, and decreases when borrowing members use the currency to makerepayments. Reserve tranche positions are part of members’ liquid interna-\ntional reserves because a member may, subject only to its representation of a\nbalance of payments need, convert its SDR-denominated reserve asset into\n37See http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/quota/2000/eng/qfrg/report/index.htm and\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/quota/2000/eng/qfrg/comment/index.htm.\n38See http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/quota/2001/eng/erqfq.htm.\nII General Department\n65one or more freely usable currencies by drawing on the IMF (Box II.8). A\nmember is obligated, if necessary, to provide an amount of reserve assets of\nup to 100 percent of its quota. The amount of reserve assets provided to the\nIMF has in practice fallen well below this maximum (Figure II.5).\nThe IMF pays interest, called remuneration, on a member’s reserve posi-\ntion in the IMF, except on a small portion that is provided to the IMF as an\ninterest-free resource. This unremunerated (non-interest-bearing) portion\nof the reserve tranche position is equal to 25 percent of the member’s quota\non April 1, 1978 —that part of the quota that was paid in gold prior to the\nSecond Amendment of the IMF’s Articles. The gold tranche was never\nremunerated historically, so it was natural to set aside this same amount in\nterms of SDRs on this date as the unremunerated reserve tranche. For a\nmember that joined the IMF after that date, the unremunerated reserve\ntranche is the same percentage of its initial quota as the average unremuner-\nated reserve tranche was as a percentage of the quotas of all other members\nwhen the new member joined the IMF . The unremunerated reserve tranche\nremains fixed for each member in nominal terms, but because of subsequent\nquota increases, it is now significantly lower when expressed as a percentage\nof quota.39 The average is equal to 3.8 percent, but the actual percentage is\ndifferent for each member.\nPrecautionary Balances\nThe IMF’s resources in the GRA increase through additions to its precau-\ntionary balances, which comprise reserves and balances that have been set\naside in the first Special Contingent Account (SCA-1). The level and rate of\naccumulation of precautionary balances reflect the IMF’s assessment of therisk of future operational deficits and general credit risk, including that aris-\n39In the past, the proportion of the reserve tranche that was remunerated was sometimes\nrelated to the concept of the “norm” for remuneration, which was calculated as the total of\n(1) 75 percent of a member’s quota before the Second Amendment, plus (2) any subse-\nquent increases in quota. For a country that became a member after April 1, 1978, the\nnorm is a percentage of its quota equal to the weighted average relative to quota of the\nnorms applicable to all other members on the date that the member joined the IMF, plus\nthe amounts of any increases in its quota afterward. At each quota increase, a member’snorm rises, becoming closer to 100 percent of its quota. The remunerated reserve tranche\nexcludes certain holdings: all currency holdings acquired when the member used IMF\nresources, and currency holdings in the IMF No. 2 Account that are less than \n1⁄10 of 1 per-\ncent of the member’s quota.

This latter risk increases withthe level and concentration of outstanding credit, but is contained by thepositive economic effects of members’ adjustment policies and the IMF’s\npreferred creditor status. Reserves also provide a small amount of liquidity\nin the GRA. The level and composition of the precautionary balances in theGRA in recent years are shown in Table II.5.\nReserves reflect accumulated net income and comprise the Special Reserve\nand the General Reserve. Resources in the Special Reserve may be used for\nany purpose for which resources in the General Reserve may be used, except\ndistribution.\n• The Special Reserve was established in 1957, initially with the proceeds\nfrom a gold investment program, to provide safeguards against opera-tional deficits that were subsequently charged against this reserve.\nAdditions to the Special Reserve have since been financed from net\nincome, other than income derived from the SRF.\n• The General Reserve was established in 1958 to meet capital losses or\nadministrative deficits. From FY1998, SRF net income has been placedBOX II.8. R ESERVE  TRANCHE  POLICIES\nThe reserve tranche can be considered as the “facility of first resort.” It\nstands apart from the credit tranches and the various facilities in that a mem-\nber’s reserve tranche position is part of its own foreign exchange reserves. Pur-\nchases in the reserve tranche do not therefore constitute use of IMF credit. Topreserve this character as a reserve asset available at the discretion of themember, the IMF has adopted reserve tranche policies:\n• The definition of the reserve tranche (quota less holdings of the member’s\ncurrency) explicitly excludes currency holdings arising from past use of IMFcredit. This is intended to enable members to make purchases in the credit\ntranches without having first to use their reserve tranche. The member can\nchoose which resources to use first.\n• Purchases in the reserve tranche are subject to a representation by the\nmember of a balance of payments need, as with any use of IMF resources, but\nthe member’s representation of need cannot be challenged by the IMF.\n• Reserve tranche purchases are not subj ect to conditi onalit y , charges , or\nrepurchase expectations and obligations.\nII General Department\n67in the General Reserve, which is the only income placed in this reserve\nsince 1971. Any distribution of the General Reserve must be made to\nall members in proportion to their quotas.\nSpecial Contingent Accounts (SCAs) are established and balances accu-\nmulated as part of the IMF’s overall strategy to protect itself against the neg-\native financial impact of protracted arrears, that is, obligations that have\nremained overdue for at least six months.40 The SCA-1 was established in\n1987 as a safeguard against potential losses resulting from an ultimate failure\nof members in protracted arrears to settle their financial obligations to the\nIMF.

These allocations have amounted to 5 percent of GRA reserves\nat the beginning of the year up until FY2001, when the allocation was\nreduced to 3.3 percent. Balances in the SCA-1 are refundable to the contrib-uting debtor and creditor member countries when all overdue obligations\nhave been settled, or earlier if the IMF so decides.\n41\nThe IMF’s objective to date has been to maintain a level of total precau-\ntionary balances at least equal to credit to members in protracted arrears, agoal that was first achieved in FY1993, and which has since been maintained.\n41A second Special Contingent Account (SCA-2) was established as a safeguard against\npossible losses arising from purchases made through the encashment of rights accumulated\nunder a rights accumulation program (RAP), and to provide additional liquidity for the\nfinancing of those encashments (see Box II.9 and Chapter V). SCA-2 was terminated in1999.\nII General Department\n69In addition, to protect itself against general credit risk, the IMF has estab-\nlished a target for precautionary balances in excess of overdue credit. Thetarget range for these “free reserves” is 3–5 percent of the amount of out-standing “credit in good standing.” Free reserves had risen to 8.0 percent of\ncredit in good standing at end-April 2001 (see Table II.5).BOX II.9. T HE BURDEN -SHARING  MECHANISM\nSince 1986, the burden-sharing mechanism has made up for the loss of\nincome from unpaid charges and has been used to accumulate resources in twoSpecial Contingent Accounts (SCAs). The mechanism works by providing foradditions and deductions to the rates of charge and remuneration, respectively.\nResources collected from individual members under the mechanism are\nrefundable to them as arrears cases are resolved, or as may be decided by theIMF. Thus, resources collected for unpaid charges are refunded when thesecharges are eventually settled. At end-April 2001, cumulative deferred chargesthat were subject to burden sharing amounted to SDR 1,796 million and settle-ments of unpaid charges of SDR 993 million had been made and refunded.\nOf the two Special Contingent Accounts, the first, SCA-1, was established\nspecifically to protect against the financial impact of arrears in general. Thesecond, SCA-2, collected resources (1) to finance the encashment of “rights”earned by eligible members in arrears to later draw on IMF resources, and(2) to safeguard against the risk of loss arising from purchases made in connec-tion with the encashment of rights. SCA-2 was terminated in 1999, and the bal-ances in the account refunded, after it was concluded that other precautionarybalances in the GRA provided adequate protection against the risks associ-ated with rights-related credit. The termination of SCA-2 was also part of anoverall agreement on the financing of the PRGF (then ESAF) and HIPC initi-atives, for which it was envisaged that some members would voluntarily con-tribute resources refunded from SCA-2.\nIn the aggregate, creditor and debtor members have contributed equal\namounts for unpaid charges and for allocations to the SCA-1, whereas credi-tors provided three-fourths of the amounts contributed to the SCA-2. A totalof SDR 1.2 billion had been accumulated in the SCA-1 at end-April 2001. Atotal of SDR 1 billion was accumulated during the operation of the SCA-2in 1990–97.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n70Income and Expenses\nThe amount added to reserves each year is the net income resulting from\nthe difference between operational income and operational and administra-\ntive expenses.\nVirtually all of the IMF’s operational income is derived from the charges\n(interest on loans) that are levied on the outstanding use of credit in the\nGRA. In addition to the basic rate of charge (i.e., the rate of charge before\nburden sharing), the use of IMF credit under certain circumstances is subjectto surcharges, and all IMF credit is subject to service charges, commitment\nfees on credit lines, and special charges (see Table II.2).\n42 A small amount of\nincome is also generated by receipts of interest on the IMF’s SDR holdings(as explained in Chapter III).\nOperational expenses consist of the remuneration (interest) paid on\nremunerated reserve tranche positions, the allocation to the SCA-1, and thepayment of interest on outstanding IMF borrowing, if any. Net operational\nincome (operational income less operational expenses) is used to cover the\nIMF’s administrative expenses, and the remainder constitutes net income(Table II.6).\n43\nOperational Income\nThe IMF aims to achieve a target level of net income each financial year\nto add to its reserves.44 Based on the net income target, the SDR interest\nrate, projected credit, and the outlook for administrative expenses, the IMF\nestimates the basic rate of charge that is necessary to achieve the income tar-get.\n45 The basic rate is set for the year as a proportion of the SDR interest\nrate. For FY2001, this proportion was set at 115.9 percent.\n42The IMF also has access to a relatively small amount of interest-free resources, includ-\ning its precautionary balances and the unremunerated portion of reserve tranche positions\nof members. \n43The Income Statement of the General Department also includes the income of the\nSDA, which is discussed later in this chapter.\n44The annual increase in reserves was set as 3 percent of reserves in the GRA at the\nbeginning of the year for financial years 1981–84, 5 percent for financial years 1985–99, 3.9\npercent for financial year 2000, and 1.7 percent for financial years 2001–02. These figures\nexclude income from surcharges.\n45The procedure setting the basic rate of charge is governed by Rule I-6(4).\nII General Department\n71TABLE  II.6.

Alternatively, the Boardcan decide to:\n• place all or part of any excess to reserves; or\n• make a distribution of excess income to members; or• take the excess into account to lower the net income target for the sub-\nsequent financial year.\nWhen net income falls short of the target, the Executive Board has gener-\nally decided to increase the rate of charge in the subsequent financial year to\nmake up for the shortfall.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n72Operational Expenses\nThe IMF pays remuneration (interest) on members’ reserve tranche posi-\ntions equal to the SDR interest rate, except on a small portion, as indicatedearlier (see section on “Reserve Tranche Positions”).\n46 Remuneration pay-\nments account for almost all of IMF operational expenses when there is no\noutstanding IMF borrowing. If borrowing is outstanding, the IMF also paysinterest on it. The interest rate on borrowing under the General Arrange-\nments to Borrow (GAB) is equal to the SDR interest rate, while under the\nNew Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), it may be equal to or higher than theSDR interest rate, as explained below under “Borrowing.”\nAdministrative Expenses\nThe IMF’s administrative expenses can be divided into personnel, travel,\nbuilding occupancy, and other such costs. Personnel and travel-related out-\nlays typically account for about 80 percent of total administrative expenses.The GRA is reimbursed for the cost of administering the SDR Department\nthrough an assessment levied in proportion to each participant’s allocation\nof SDRs. The GRA is also to be reimbursed for the expenses incurred inadministering the PRGF Trust. However, following the establishment of the\nSRF and the consequent increase in net income, this reimbursement has\nbeen forgone and the amount that would otherwise have been reimbursedhas been transferred to the PRGF-HIPC Trust. This arrangement has been\nin place since 1998 and is expected to continue up to 2004.\nBorrowing\nThe IMF can borrow to supplement its quota resources. It maintains two\nstanding borrowing arrangements with official lenders and can borrow from\nprivate markets, although it has not done so to date. Borrowing has playedan important role in providing temporary, supplemental resources to the\nIMF at critical junctures in the past (Table II.7). In recent years, the borrow-\ning arrangements with official lenders have been enlarged and their partici-pation broadened, strengthening IMF liquidity.\n46/G01The basic (unadjusted) rate of remuneration has been equal to the SDR interest rate\nsince February 1, 1987. However, refundable adjustments to that rate are made under\n“burden sharing.” The Articles require that the rate of remuneration be maintained in the\nrange of 80–100 percent of the SDR interest rate. The current relationship between therate of remuneration and the SDR interest rate is governed by Rule I-10. \nII General Department\n73TABLE  II.7.

The\nGAB were originally conceived as arrangements whereby the main industrial(Group of Ten) countries agreed to stand ready to lend the IMF up to speci-fied amounts of their currencies, thereby strengthening its financial position.These loans would be made when supplementary resources were needed bythe IMF to help finance drawings by GAB participants in a setting where such\nfinancing would forestall or cope with an impairment of the international\nmonetary system. Because the industrial countries have the largest quotasand may, when they need to, claim a large proportion of the IMF’s usableresources, the GAB provide strong support for the IMF’s financial soundnessand for ensuring that resources available to other countries are not reduced.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n74The GAB enable the IMF to borrow specified amounts of currencies from\n11 industrial countries or their central banks, under certain circumstances, at\nmarket-related rates of interest (Table II.8). The potential amount of creditavailable to the IMF under the GAB is SDR 17 billion, with an additional\nSDR 1.5 billion available under an associated agreement with Saudi Arabia.\nThe GAB are reviewed and renewed regularly. A broad review of the\nGAB was undertaken in 1983, at the outset of the developing country debtcrisis. The most important changes to emerge from that review were the sub-\nstantial enlargement of the GAB to its present size (from about SDR 6 bil-\nlion), the addition of SDR 1.5 billion under the associated agreement withSaudi Arabia, and the change to permit use of the GAB to finance IMF\nlending to nonparticipants in the GAB if the IMF faces an inadequacy of\nr e s o u r c e s .

The GAB were last activated in\nJuly 1998 for an amount of SDR 6.3 billion (SDR 1.4 billion of which was\ndrawn) in connection with the financing of an Extended Arrangement forRussia. The activation for Russia was canceled in March 1999, when the IMF\nrepaid the outstanding amount following the coming into effect of the Elev-\nenth General Review of Quotas and payment of the bulk of the quotaincreases. Prior to the activation for Russia, the most recent activation\noccurred in 1977, when the IMF borrowed for lending to the United Kingdom\nand Italy under Stand-By Arrangements, and in 1978 to finance a reservetranche purchase by the United States. A proposal for calls on the GAB by\nthe IMF’s Managing Director can become effective only if it is accepted by the\nGAB participants, and the proposal is then approved by the Executive Board.\nThe IMF also has New Arrangements to Borrow to deal with financial cri-\nses. Following the Mexican financial crisis in December 1994, concern that\nsubstantially more resources might be needed to respond to future financial\ncrises prompted participants in the June 1995 Group of Seven Halifax Sum-mit to call on the Group of Ten and other financially strong countries to\ndevelop financing arrangements that would double the amount available to\nthe IMF under the GAB. The NAB became effective on November 17, 1998.\nThe NAB effectively double the resources available under the GAB. The\nNAB are a set of credit arrangements between the IMF and 25 members and\ninstitutions to provide supplementary resources to the IMF to forestall or\ncope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to dealwith an exceptional situation to the stability of that system.

The total amount of resources available to the IMFunder the NAB and GAB combined is SDR 34 billion.\nThe NAB can be renewed and enlarged. The NAB decision will be in\neffect for five years from its effective date and may be renewed, at whichtime an IMF member or institution that is not currently a participant in theNAB may be accepted as a participant, if the IMF and participants repre-senting 80 percent of the total credit arrangements agree to the request. Newparticipants may be accepted at other times by way of an amendment to theNAB adopted by a decision of the IMF’s Executive Board and with the con-currence of participants representing 85 percent of total credit arrange-ments. Commitments from participants are based on relative economicstrength, as measured by actual IMF quotas, as a predominant criterion.\nActivation procedures for the NAB are modeled on the GAB. The NAB\nhave been activated once\n—to finance a Stand-By Arrangement for Brazil in\nDecember 1998, when the IMF called on funding of SDR 9.1 billion (SDR2.9 billion of which was used). This activation was canceled on March 11,1999, when the IMF repaid the outstanding amount following the entry intoeffect of the Eleventh General Review of Quotas and payment of the bulkof the quota increases.\nPast Borrowing Arrangements\nThe IMF borrowed extensively when payments imbalances were large and\npersistent. Reliance on borrowing was especially heavy during the period oflarge payments imbalances between the early 1970s and the mid-1980s, whenborrowing financed 40–60 percent of IMF credit. The need for supplemental\nresources to meet the heavy demand for IMF resources stemmed in partfrom the relatively small increases in quotas approved in the 1970s, and theneed to bridge to the increases in quotas in 1980 and 1983. Also importantwas the skewed distribution of payments imbalances relative to the distribu-tion of quotas at the time:\n• large payments surpluses were concentrated in a comparatively small\nnumber of members with relatively small quotas; and\n• payments deficits were far more widely dispersed and were large rela-\ntive to the quotas of most members.\nThe IMF has borrowed only from official sources. Borrowing has been\nalmost exclusively from members or their monetary authorities, the excep-tions being nonmember Switzerland (now a member), the Hong Kong Mon-\nII General Department\n77etary Authority (under the NAB), and the Bank for International\nSettlements (BIS). Borrowing from official sources has the advantage thatthese lenders are familiar with the IMF’s needs and operational features,and there is by now a substantial body of experience from which to draw.The IMF is permitted to borrow from private sources and has consideredthis option on several occasions: the prevailing view has been that resort toprivate market borrowing would change the cooperative and monetarynature of the institution in ways that would be undesirable; a number ofoperational issues would also need to be addressed, such as the use of collat-eral, managing financial risk, and the cost relative to official borrowing.\nBorrowing arrangements share many common characteristics:\n•Denomination of borrowing . The indebtedness of members to the IMF\nis denominated in SDRs. To avoid exchange risks, IMF borrowing has\ngenerally been denominated in SDRs or the currencies that make upthe SDR basket in proportion to their weight in that basket.\n•Media of payment . The IMF cannot borrow SDRs. In most bilateral bor-\nrowing agreements, the lender has provided U.S. dollars or its own freelyusable currency, or the lender has undertaken to convert its currency intoa freely usable currency as needed by the IMF. For repayment, the IMFhas generally sought maximum flexibility in the borrowing agreementbut lenders have on occasion insisted on repayment in the currency of\ntheir choice, usually U.S. dollars or their own currency.\n•Maturities . The IMF seeks to match the maturities of its assets and liabil-\nities. Under the two Oil Facilities and the SFF, for example, the IMF bor-\nrowed when currency was needed for purchase and repaid lenders when\nthe corresponding repurchases were made. This was not possible underthe borrowing agreements established for the Enlarged Access Policy(EAP), as some central banks were willing to lend only at the short endof the maturity spectrum (see Table II.7). The resulting mismatch ofmaturities led to the establishment of Borrowed Resources Suspense\nAccounts within the GRA as a means of holding and investing tempo-\nrarily currencies not yet needed to finance purchases under the EAP .\n•Liquidity and transferability . Borrowing agreements with lenders other\nthan the BIS have consistently provided for encashability at face value\nupon representation of balance of payments need. These agreements\nfurther stipulate that the IMF would give such a representation theoverwhelming benefit of the doubt. A member’s lending to the IMF istherefore regarded as a liquid reserve asset and is included as part ofthe member’s international reserves. In addition, claims on the IMF are\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n78normally transferable to other official holders, which provides some\nprotection to the IMF’s liquidity.\n•Interest rates.  In the early years of the IMF, interest rates on IMF bor-\nrowing and charges on purchases financed by borrowed resources werevery low. Following the introduction of remuneration with the FirstAmendment of the Articles of Agreement in 1969, more attention waspaid to the rate of return on the reserves that members made available tothe IMF. Market rates were increasingly seen by members as the oppor-tunity cost of lending to the IMF. In line with market practice, borrowingagreements since 1977 have provided for floating interest rates. To pro-tect the IMF’s income position, the cost of borrowing plus a small marginhas been reflected in the rate of charge on the use of borrowed resources.\nManagement of Financial Resources\nand the Liquidity Position\nfor lending. The IMF’s usable resources consist of currencies of IMF mem-\nbers with a strong balance of payments position and SDRs, which stemmainly from quota payments. The institution maintains substantial holdingsof gold and other fixed assets, but these are not used in lending operations.Borrowing by the IMF to finance the extension of credit through the GRA isan important complement to the use of its quota resources but remains theexception rather than the rule. Borrowing is, however, a central feature ofIMF lending under the PRGF, as discussed in Chapter IV .\nThe usability of the IMF’s currency holdings varies over time. In principle,\nthe currencies of all members are available for use in IMF transactions.Members have an obligation to convert balances of their currency purchasedfrom the IMF by other members into one of the four freely usable curren-\n47\nposition to meet this currency exchange obligation when drawing up itsquarterly financial transactions plan (see below). The currencies of these\n47Article V, Section 3 (e)(i).As noted above, not all of the IMF’s resources are immediately available\ncies: the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the pound sterling.\nThe IMF determines which members are in a sufficiently strong external\nII General Department\n79members are considered to be usable in IMF transactions for the duration of\nthat quarter, while all other currencies are considered unusable.\nThe IMF’s holdings of SDRs are a readily usable resource, but these hold-\nings account for only a small fraction of the IMF’s assets. The use of SDRs\nheld by the IMF is therefore not limited to the same extent as the use of itscurrency holdings. The IMF periodically establishes a long-term target range\nfor the level of its SDR holdings, which guides the actual use of SDRs in\nIMF transactions. Other factors affecting the level of the IMF’s holdings ofSDRs are discussed in Chapter III.\nThe IMF closely monitors its liquidity position. Table II.9 presents the\nIMF’s financial resources and liquidity position as of April 30, 2001.\n48 F or\nthis purpose, the stock of usable resources is adjusted downward to take intoaccount amounts already committed to members under existing IMF\narrangements. A further downward adjustment is made to ensure that the\nIMF retains at all times sufficient working balances of each of the currenciesof members included in the financial transactions plan. The resulting\namount of net uncommitted usable resources is in principle available to\nmeet new demand for IMF resources. In practice, however, the adequacy of\nthe IMF’s liquidity position must also take into account the existence of liq-\nuid claims accumulated by its creditor members: reserve tranche positionsand any outstanding loans under the GAB and NAB. These are considered\nliquid liabilities because they can be drawn at short notice in the event of\nbalance of payments need, akin to demand deposits in a commercial bank,and are thus the first claim on IMF resources. The liquidity ratio ties these\ntwo concepts together in a single measure of the IMF’s liquidity. Historically,\nthe liquidity ratio has never fallen below 25–30 percent.\nFinancial Transactions Plan\nThe IMF manages its usable resources through a financial transactions\nplan. This is the mechanism through which the IMF selects the memberswhose currencies are to be used in IMF transactions and allocates thefinancing of those transactions among members included in the plan.

The total amount for transfers in the trans-\nactions plan is based on the expected volume of credit to be extended tomembers and operational payments by the IMF (such as interest on official\nborrowing by the IMF) during the plan period. Receipts in currencies are\nestimated on the basis of the schedule of forthcoming repayments and thepreferences of members with respect to the media of payment (i.e., curren-\ncies versus SDRs).\nII General Department\n81Currency selection is based on judgments about the external positions of\nmembers. The currencies of members are selected for inclusion in the finan-\ncial transactions plan based on a finding by the IMF that the member’s bal-\nance of payments and reserve position is sufficiently strong. Specific indicators\nof external strength are used to maintain a reasonable degree of consistency\namong members, but the assessment of a member’s combined balance of pay-ments and reserve position is ultimately a matter of judgment. It has not\ntherefore been considered desirable to rely on automatic indicators or to\ndefine rigidly the notion of a sufficiently strong external position; the circum-stances of members, including their need to hold reserves, differ considerably.\nAll relevant factors and data are considered in this assessment. Particular\nemphasis is placed on recent and prospective current account balances,\nexternal competitiveness, and external debt indicators, especially those\noffering insights into the member’s exposure to short-term liquidity strains.Members may be included in the financial transactions plan even though\nthere may be some elements of weakness in their overall balance of pay-\nments and reserve position.\nTwo broader considerations underlying the financial structure of the IMF\nhave guided the staff and the Executive Board in coming to conclusionsabout a member’s external strength for the purpose of participation in the\nfinancial transactions plan.\n• First, the IMF draws on a wide range of members\n—large and small,\nadvanced, developing, and transition —for its financial activities, reflect-\ning first and foremost the cooperative nature of the institution. Broad\nparticipation of members in the financial transactions plan also works to\nmaximize the liquidity of the GRA.\n• Second, the use of a member’s currency in the financial transactions plan\ngenerally entails a change in the composition of the member’s interna-\ntional reserves. For most of these members, IMF transactions involve a\nreduction (increase) in their foreign exchange holdings, which is fullyoffset by an increase (decrease) in their reserve tranche position in theIMF . This creditor position is included as part of the member’s interna-\ntional reserves as it is a liquid claim on foreign exchange resources that\ncan be drawn on demand in the event of balance of payments need.\nDecisions on the selection of currencies are taken by the Executive\nBoard. The staff proposes a list of members it considers sufficiently strongeach quarter, and the Executive Board takes a decision based on this list. It\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n82is open to an Executive Director to request the exclusion or inclusion of any\nmember, but the decision rests with the Executive Board as a whole. Amember’s consent to its inclusion is not required, although its views on itsbalance of payments and reserve position are taken into account by theExecutive Board before a decision is taken. The outcome of the financial\ntransactions plan is published on the IMF’s website.\n49\nCurrency allocation aims to maintain broadly even participation among\nmembers. The allocation of transfers and receipts among members in thefinancial transactions plan is based on guidelines established by the ExecutiveBoard.\n50 The currencies of all members included in the financial transactions\nplan are allocated for transfers in direct proportion to their quotas. Receipts\nare allocated to members’ currencies included in the plan so as to ensure that\nthe creditor positions of members included in the plan remain broadly bal-anced over time in relation to quota. The net impact of both transfers andreceipts on reserve tranche positions is illustrated in Figure II.6.\nIf a currency included in the financial transactions plan is not one of the\ncurrencies that the IMF has determined to be freely usable in the principal\nforeign exchange markets, the issuing member is required, if requested by a\npurchasing member at the time of the purchase, to exchange the amount ofits currency sold by the IMF for a freely usable currency (in most cases, theU.S. dollar) at the representative exchange rate as advised by the IMF. Pro-cedures have also been established for the exchange of each freely usablecurrency into other freely usable currencies. Similar procedures apply to\nexchanges of currencies related to repurchases.\nSpecial Disbursement Account\nThe SDA was initially activated to receive transfers from the Trust Fund.\nThe Trust Fund had been funded largely from the sale of gold and upon itstermination in 1981, all Trust Fund loan repayments were transferred to theSDA. Loans were provided from the SDA under the Structural AdjustmentFacility (SAF), which was established in March 1986 to provide balance of\n49The “Quarterly Report on Financing IMF Transactions” is posted one quarter after\nthe end of the period on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/ftp).\n50See S elected Decisions and Documents of the International Monetary Fund  (Washing-\nton: IMF, Twenty-Fifth Issue, June 30, 2000), pp. 260–65. \nII General Department\n83FIGURE  II.6.

These assets originate from the transfers received from the Trust Fundand the profits from the sale of a portion of the IMF’s gold in financial year2000. The net income from the investment of gold profits has been autho-rized for transfers, on an as-needed basis in accordance with the decisions ofthe IMF, to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility–Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Trust (PRGF-HIPC Trust).\nChapter IV discusses the financing and conduct of concessional lending by\nthe IMF, including the investment of SDA resources.\nIMF Accounts in Member Countries\nThe IMF conducts its financial dealings with a member through the fiscal\nagency and the depository designated by the member. The fiscal agency may\nbe the member’s treasury (ministry of finance), central bank, official mone-tary agency, stabilization fund, or other similar agency. The IMF can only\ndeal with, or through, the designated fiscal agency, which is authorized to\ncarry out transactions with the IMF on behalf of the member country. Inaddition, each member is required to designate its central bank as a deposi-\ntory for the IMF’s holdings of the member’s currency, or if it has no central\nbank, a monetary agency or a commercial bank acceptable to the IMF. Mostmembers of the IMF have designated their central bank as both the deposi-\ntory and the fiscal agency. The depository is required to pay out of the IMF’s\nholdings of the member’s currency, on demand and without delay, sums toany payee named by the IMF in the member’s own territory, and to hold\nsecurities on behalf of the IMF should the member decide to issue nonnego-\ntiable, non-interest-bearing notes, or similar instruments, in substitution forpart of the IMF’s currency holdings. Each member guarantees all assets of\nthe IMF against loss resulting from failure or default on the part of the\n51Interest on SAF loans is charged at ½ of 1 percent a year.\nII General Department\n85depository. Thus, the IMF’s pool of currencies and reserve assets in the\nGRA are not held at the IMF, but in depositories in the member countries.\nThe depository maintains, without any service charge or commission, two\naccounts that are used to record the IMF’s holdings of the member’s currency:\nthe IMF No. 1 Account and the IMF No. 2 Account. The No. 1 Account isused for IMF transactions, including subscription payments, purchases and\nrepurchases (i.e., use and repayment of GRA resources), and repayment of\nresources borrowed by the IMF. Payment of charges on the use of IMF creditand the IMF’s payment of interest on reserve tranche positions are conducted\nin SDRs and therefore not recorded in these accounts. Provided that a mini-\nmum is maintained in the No. 1 Account, as explained below, all these transac-tions can alternatively be carried out through the IMF Securities Account. A\nmember may establish an IMF Securities Account in order to substitute parts\nof the holdings in the IMF No. 1 Account with nonnegotiable, non-inter-est-bearing notes, or similar instruments payable to the IMF on demand when\nthe currency is needed for the IMF’s transactions. The depository holds these\nnotes for safekeeping and acts as the agent of the IMF to obtain encashmentof the notes in order to maintain, at all times, the minimum required balance\nin the No. 1 Account.\n52\nThe No. 2 Account is used for the IMF’s administrative expenditures and\nreceipts (for example, from sales of IMF publications) in the member’s cur-rency and within its territory. The balances in both the No. 1 and No. 2Accounts that originate from the payment of the local currency portion ofquota subscriptions do not yield any interest for the IMF. The currency por-tion of the subscribed capital, while fully paid, is held in non-interest-bearingform and generates no income for the IMF until used and converted intoclaims on members in the form of use of IMF credit.\nDisclosure of Financial Position with the IMF in the\nMember Country53\nWhen a member has designated the central bank as both depository and\nfiscal agent, the central bank should present the full financial position of the\n52If any payment by the IMF reduces the balance in the No. 1 Account below a mini-\nmum of ¼ of 1 percent of the member’s quota, the balance is to be restored to that level by\nthe next business day through the encashment of sufficient notes.\n53This discussion presents IMF member positions in the General and SDR Departments.\nFINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE IMF\n86member with the IMF in its balance sheet.54 A central bank may choose to\nindicate this on either a gross or net basis. The position in the GeneralDepartment is presented on a gross basis if the IMF No. 1, No. 2, and Securi-ties Accounts are shown as liabilities and the member’s quota is shown as anasset. Membership in the SDR Department would be indicated by showingSDR holdings as an asset and the cumulative SDR allocation as a liability.\nMembers may also choose to reflect their financial position on a net basis.\nA member who has a net reserve tranche position in the IMF and is notusing IMF credit would present the net reserve tranche position as anasset.\n55 Members with a net reserve tranche position who are also using\ncredit in the GRA would disclose the reserve tranche as an asset and cur-rency holdings stemming from the use of IMF credit as a liability, since theIMF is not entitled to demand settlement or offset a member’s use of credit\nfrom its reserve tranche position. The members’ position in the SDRDepartment may also be shown on a net basis. The presentation of IMF-related assets and liabilities should be further elaborated in the explanatorynotes to the financial statements and, as a minimum, provide informationnot available in the balance sheet regarding the member’s quota, the compo-\nsition of the IMF’s currency holdings, and the maturity structure of IMFcredit, if any.\nIn cases where the central bank acts as depository and the ministry of\nfinance, treasury, or a similar agency is the fiscal agent, it is recommendedthat the central bank record all IMF-related assets and liabilities and offsetthese against government accounts.\n56 While practices may differ depending\non the relationship between the central bank and the agency acting as fiscalagent, this approach ensures public disclosure of the member’s financialrelationship with the IMF, since government agencies typically do not pre-\n  \n54For this reason it is also recommended to include the Securities Account in the IMF\nposition, even though the actual securities may be issued by the government. The IMF con-\nsiders securities issued in lieu of currency deposits to the IMF No. 1 Account equivalent to\ncurrency holdings because they are encashable on demand. Exclusion of the Securities\nAccount would therefore misrepresent the member’s overall IMF position.\n55A member has a net reserve tranche position when its quota exceeds the IMF’s hold-\nings of its currencies, excluding currencies stemming from the use of IMF credit and hold-\nings in the No. 2 Account that are less than 1⁄10 of 1 percent of quota.\n56Of the IMF’s 183 member countries, only 41 have not designated their central bank as\nthe fiscal agent.\nII General Department\n87pare financial statements.57 Consolidating the IMF position in the balance\nsheet of the central bank also allows for a simple reconciliation between for-eign reserves data monitored under an IMF-supported program or pub-lished by a member and the balance sheet of the central bank. Since mostcentral banks are subject to an annual audit, full inclusion of the IMF posi-tion provides additional assurance about the accuracy and availability of for-eign reserves.\nAppendix IV illustrates how IMF membership could be presented on\neither a gross or net basis in the balance sheet of a central bank that acts asboth fiscal agent and depository for the member with the IMF. \n57PRGF transactions would also be shown in the balance sheet of the central bank if the\ncentral bank were the recipient of the proceeds of PRGF disbursements."

Together, we represent a world \nof cultures, backgrounds, and skills that can only be fully engaged if we continuously recognize and value our diﬀ  erences and live our core Fund values of excellence, honesty, impartiality, inclusion, integrity, and respect . With inclusion as one of those core values, our legitimacy and credibility stem from our \nability to be truly inclusive so that our employees can perform at their best to serve our membership.\nThe IMF continues to make strides in gender representation. For the ﬁ  rst time \nin its history, three of the Fund’s ﬁ  ve top leaders are women and since October 2019, half of the newly appointed Heads of Departments and O/uniFB03   ces are women. \nOur e/uniFB00  orts to have a more balanced regional representation continued, notwith-\nstanding the pandemic. We leveraged digital platforms to increase our recruitment missions three-fold, with much of this increase focused on our three under-rep-resented regions. While we were able to meet our objectives for two of these, Sub-Saharan Africa, and East Asia, we continue to face challenges in achieving the representation we aspire to for sta/uniFB00   from the Middle East and North Africa. \nSince 2019, we have implemented a more robust accountability mechanism to \nensure that managers contribute more proactively to achieving our diversity objectives and creating a more inclusive work environment through their recruit-ment, sta/uniFB00   development, performance assessment, and promotion decisions. While we maintain our focus on gender and regional representation, we are expanding the scope of our inclusion e/uniFB00  orts. For instance, we have focused many of our initiatives towards promoting racial equity and justice and gaining a better understanding of the full diversity of our sta/uniFB00  . We have also relaunched a working group on disabilities and created an Employee Resource Group, THRIVE, to ensure that employees with a disability and those caring for dependents with disabilities have a voice in shaping our future work environment. \nEach one of us is responsible for contributing to diversity and inclusion. The e/uniFB00  ort \nof nurturing a culture of inclusion is challenging, but possible through continu-ously adjusting behaviors and creating an environment where we all feel a sense of belonging. We must all work together to continue to build on the progress already made and to achieve the diverse and inclusive Fund that we all desire.\nKRISTALINA GEORGIEVAManaging Director\n2020–2021 Report i\nContents Foreword by the Managing Director  ............................................................. i\nAcronyms  ................................................................................. iv\nExecutive  Summary  ......................................................................... 1\nIntroduction  ................................................................................ 2\nDiversity  ................................................................................... 3\n• Staﬀ   Composition\n• Progress Towards FY 2025 Diversity Benchmarks\nRecruitment  ................................................................................ 9\n• Trends\n• Mid-Career Fungible Economists\n• Economist Program\n• Future Hiring Space\n• Facing Remaining Recruitment Challenges\nPromotions  ................................................................................ 14\n• Trends for Economists\n• Trends for Specialized Career Stream Staﬀ  \n• Areas of Focus to Address Promotion Challenges\nSeparations  ................................................................................ 18\n• Trends\nBeyond the Data — Inclusion  ................................................................. 20\n• Racial Equity\n• Sponsorship Program\n• Disabilities\n• Diversity and Inclusion Training\n• Use of Preferred Pronouns\nHolding Managers Accountable  ............................................................... 25\n• Signaling from the Highest Level\n• Setting the FY 2025 Benchmarks\n• Departmental Diversity and Inclusion Action Plans\n• Accountability Framework\n• Diversity and Inclusion Survey\nConclusion and Roadmap for Next 2 Years  ....................................................... 27\nBoxes\n1.

A summary of the results of the annual pay gap analysis (PGA), conducted in FY 2021, which for the /f_i  rst time included a race component, is available in Annex 1.\nSta/uniFB00   Composition: The composition of IMF employees by gender, career stream, \nregion, and education has not signiﬁ  cantly changed since the 2019 D&I Report, although the IMF has seen an increase in the share of contractual employees in the last two years.\nStatus against the FY 2025 Benchmarks : The share of sta/uniFB00   members at the indi-\nvidual contributor level (A9–A14/A15) has exceeded the benchmarks for nationals \nfrom East Asia (15.2 percent vs. 15 percent target) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (9.2 percent vs. 8 percent target), but the IMF continues to struggle to meet the benchmark for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA+) region (5.7 percent vs 8 percent target). At the managerial level, the new benchmark framework increased the targets for representation of both women and those from underrepresented regions (URRs). As such, at the end of FY 2021, attainment of managerial bench-marks is considerably lagging across the board, although sustained progress has been seen in the share of women in these roles, and there is su/uniFB03   cient time to meet the targets.\nRecruitment:  The IMF leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions by \npivoting to virtual sourcing and talent attraction, increasing the number of recruit-\nment missions by 300 percent. Hiring trends show an improvement in the share of MENA+ nationals recruited, particularly in FY 2021, but progress remains slow.\nPromotions:  The report covers promotions from professional to managerial roles \nand from administrative to professional levels. The trend of higher rates of promo-\ntion for women continues/uni003B however, there are considerable di/uniFB00  erences in the rates of promotion between women from URRs and women from Other Regions (all regions  combined, except for URRs).Separations:  The current separation rate is about 5 percent, with most sepa-\nrations due to retirements. The number of voluntary resignations has steadily decreased since 2017. Over the last ﬁ  ve years, nationals of the MENA+ region had a higher rate of voluntary resignations than those from the other two URRs as well as a slightly higher rate than the IMF average of 1.5 percent.\nInclusion : Several important initiatives were launched in the last two years to \nfoster a more inclusive work environment in which the IMF’s diverse sta/uniFB00   can \nthrive. Racial equity and justice are now squarely on the IMF’s agenda, and URR nationals are participating in a pilot Sponsorship Program. The IMF has started to look at its policies and practices as they relate to people who identify as having a disability, and the mandatory D&I training has been updated.\nHolding Managers Accountable:  As indicated in the 2019 Report, managerial \naccountability for achieving D&I results needs to be strengthened. To this end, \nthe IMF implemented departmental action plans in FY 2021 and is updating the Accountability Framework to reﬂ  ect the FY 2025 benchmarks and key indicators included in the departmental action plans. A D&I Survey was launched in March 2021 to gauge sta/uniFB00   perceptions around, among others, belonging, inclusion, discrimination, and harassment.\nTwo-Year Framework : Over the next two years, the focus will be on leveraging \nthe approved headcount increase and higher number of retirements to improve \nthe diversity of the IMF’s sta/uniFB00  . In addition, the Fund will systematically monitor rates of promotion, implement actions to ensure equitable opportunities for career development, and continue to improve its accountability mechanisms.\n2020–2021 Report 1\nDiversity and Inclusion (D&I) continue to be business priorities for the IMF, with the full support of \nthe IMF’s Management. D&I eﬀ  orts are based on the need to ensure a level playing /f_i  eld and equitable treatment for all staﬀ   in terms of recruitment, career development, and growth opportunities.\nSince the last D&I Report in 2019, the Managing Director has reasserted the \nIMF’s commitment to D&I by issuing an updated Diversity & Inclusion statement,1 \nendorsing the FY 2025 Benchmarks framework and targets, and approving the inclusion of an expanded nondiscrimination clause in the high-level principles governing the employment policies and practices in the IMF’s Sta/uniFB00   Handbook.\nThe last IMF D&I Report proposed a signiﬁ  cant number of actions to achieve \nprogress against objectives. The 2019 D&I Report proposed a total of 46 actions, covering a range of initiatives related to recruitment, career management, and accountability. In addition, the 2025 D&I Benchmarks Working Group proposed 35 initiatives to increase the likelihood of achieving the FY 2025 Benchmarks. As the actions and initiatives were designed to span a period of one to ﬁ  ve years, there was no assumption that all would be started or implemented by the date of this report, and many are meant to be ongoing.\nAs a preamble to this 2020–21 D&I Report, it is worth taking stock of the progress \nmade in the implementation of the actions to date. Table 1 provides a numerical summary of the proposed initiatives and the progress toward their implementa-tion. Of the 81 actions, 9 (11 percent) have been completed, and 34 (42 percent) are underway. The IMF will progressively implement most of the remainder over the next three years and will consider three of the recommendations on a longer-term horizon. \nThis 2020–21 D&I Report presents an overview of the IMF’s accomplishments as \nwell as its remaining challenges.\n1 Diversity & Inclusion statement - https://www.imf.org/external/hrd/diversity.htmTable 1.

Interestingly, women are more represented among \nURR nationals than in Other Regions.4\n2  Article XII reads in part: In appointing the sta/uniFB00   the Managing Director shall, subject to the paramount \nimportance of securing the highest standards of e/uniFB03   ciency and technical competence, pay due regard to the \nimportance of recruiting personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible.”\n3  There are three under-represented regions East Asia, Middle East and North Africa+ (MENA+), and sub-Saharan \nAfrica (SSA). Annex 2 provides a list of individual countries represented in each region.\n4  “Other Regions” refers to all regions excluding URRs: that is, Asia (excl. East Asia), Europe (excl. Transition \nCountries), Other Western Hemisphere, Transition Countries, and the United States & Canada. A full list of coun-tries under each regional group can be found in Annex 3, Table 9.Setting targets (referred to as “benchmarks” at the IMF) is a way of providing an \nimpetus to increase diversity over time. The IMF ﬁ  rst established benchmarks in 2003 and has revised them several times as targets were met, and further prog-ress was deemed necessary. In early FY 2021, a new benchmark framework set the IMF on a path to achieve greater progress by the end of FY 2025. Additional details on the new framework and targets can be found in the “Holding Managers Accountable” section. This section provides a high-level view of the IMF’s popula-tion by gender, URR, career stream,\n5 and educational diversity, as well as detailed \nprogress to date against the new FY 2025 Benchmarks.\n5  There are two main career streams in the IMF: Economists and the Specialized Career Stream.\nFigure 1.

This section provides a high-level summary of the diversity of IMF employees, both sta/uniFB00   and contractual,\n6 who represent 151 member countries at \nthe end of FY 2021.\nFigure 1 shows an overview of the gender distribution of employees by regional \ngrouping, career stream, and employment type. The overall balance between women and men remains stable. Interestingly, women make up more than half of URR employees, compared to 45 percent in Other Regions. While the IMF would like to see a higher representation of women in the Economist stream, the ﬁ  gures are in line with the industry (see The Economist )\n7. The share of men \nin the contractual employment category has risen by 2.7 percentage points to 44.8 percent in the last two years, which reﬂ  ects increased hiring of contractual employees at professional levels.\n6 Contractual employees with contracts of one year or more.\n7 The Economist - https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2017/12/19/women-and-economics\n2020–2021 Report 3\nThe overall distribution of sta/uniFB00   and contractual employees by gender and career \nstream can be found in Figure 2. The share of sta/uniFB00   versus contractual employees has dropped slightly from 82.2 percent at the end of FY 2019 to 80.8 percent at the end of FY 2021, driven by an increase in the share of contractual employees in the Economist career stream. The higher share of female contractual employees in the Specialized Career Stream reﬂ  ects the concentration of assistant and administrative roles in this stream. Figure 2.

URR nationals represent 27 percent of the total sta/uniFB00   population—a 1 percentage point increase since the end of FY 2019, fueled primarily by higher shares of sta/uniFB00   from sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. In managerial roles, however, URR nationals comprise only 17.6 percent versus a cumulative benchmark of 28 percent.\nEurope (excluding Transition Countries\n8) has the highest overall representation (Figure \n3, panel 1). European nationals represent 24.5 percent of the sta/uniFB00   population, of which \n19.2 percent (almost one in ﬁ  ve) are B-level managers—accounting for 37.6 percent of all B-level managers. Similarly, while representing 7.5 percent of total sta/uniFB00  , 20 percent (one in ﬁ  ve) of Asian (excluding East Asia) nationals are B-level managers. For other regions, however, the picture is quite di/uniFB00  erent: the ratio of B-level managers to sta/uniFB00   ranges from one in eight (United States & Canada and MENA+) to one in ﬁ  fteen and one in twenty-two, respectively, for sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.\n8 Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, \nHungary, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, \nPoland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.Looking at gender by region, some notable di/uniFB00  erences emerge (Figure 3, panel 2). \nEuropean women account for only one in three (33.5 percent) of their nationals, the lowest ratio amongst all the regional groupings. Women from sub-Saharan Africa, MENA+, Asia (excluding East Asia), and Other Western Hemisphere all represent more than 40 percent of their nationals, whereas one in two sta/uniFB00   members from East Asia, Transition Countries, and the United States & Canada are women.\nWhen looking at the distribution by region, career stream, and gender (Figure 4, \npanel 1), there are some shifts compared to those reported in the 2019 Report (Figure 4, panel 2). In the Economist stream, the shares of nationals from the United States & Canada, Transition Countries, and Europe have decreased, while the shares of sta/uniFB00   from the three URRs have increased. These shifts in representation can largely be attributed to increased e/uniFB00  orts to source candidates from URRs, especially through the midcareer economist process. For the Specialized Career Streams, the data reveal an increase in nationals from the United States & Canada and a coincidental decrease in the share of sta/uniFB00   from Europe (excluding Transition Countries).\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 4\nFigure 3.

Throughout \nthe COVID-19 lockdown, the IMF has relied exclusively on virtual outreach and interviews, resulting in a 300 percent increase in recruitment missions. The Economist Program has seen a signiﬁ  cant increase in the number of virtual outreach sessions, especially to universities within URR regions. In addition, a more proactive approach was deployed to source candidates from URRs for the mid-career process. As shown in Figure 5, some slight progress has been made—at the end of FY 2021, 3 percent of sta/uniFB00   with PhDs obtained their degrees from URR universities—up from 2 percent at the end of FY 2019 and 8 percent from universities in Other Regions—up from 7 percent. At the same time, 10 percent of sta/uniFB00   from Other Western Hemisphere and SSA have PhDs from universities in URR or Other countries. Outreach and sourcing activities often bear fruit only after several years. The IMF anticipates continued progress in the years ahead but will seek to maintain the momentum and continue proactive outreach to and sourcing from universities and talent pools in lesser-represented regions and countries.\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 6\nProgress Toward FY 2025 \nDiversity Benchmarks\nThe status at the end of FY 2021 against the FY 2025 benchmarks reveals progress \nin ﬁ  ve of the eight indicators, including on A9–A14/A15 sta/uniFB00   from URRs. Despite this progress, more e/uniFB00  orts are needed, speciﬁ  cally for women and MENA+ nationals at the individual contributor level and URR sta/uniFB00   at the managerial level (Table 2). There was a slight decrease in the percentage share of representation for two of the targets, although absolute numbers have increased, and there was no change for one of the benchmarks (see arrows in the last column).  A ﬁ  ve-year trend for the benchmarks and other regional groupings can be found in Annex 3, Table 1.\nA more precise capture of the IMF’s broader diversity emerges when incorpo-\nrating sta/uniFB00   with self-declared secondary nationalities. Including sta/uniFB00   who have self-declared a secondary nationality from one of the URRs reveals a signiﬁ  cant jump in representation. More speciﬁ  cally, at the individual contributor level, for the MENA+ region the di/uniFB00  erence is +1.7 percentage points (an additional 31 sta/uniFB00   members) and for sub-Saharan Africa an increase of 0.8 percentage points (14 sta/uniFB00   members), with a similar impact for managerial roles.\nThe picture for the share of women at di/uniFB00  erent levels of the organization is mixed. \nSince the new benchmarks were introduced in July 2020, the overall number of women in the individual contributor grades (A9–A14/15) has increased slightly, but the percentage share has marginally decreased. The share of women in mana-gerial roles (A14/A15–B5) increased 1.6 percentage points to 34.5 percent in the last ﬁ  scal year, with an even stronger performance at the most senior levels (B4 and B5). These gains reﬂ  ect the continued e/uniFB00  orts by management to rebalance gender in managerial roles.\nFinally, the IMF continues to encourage the Executive Board to lead by example. \nThe IMF recognizes the commitment to promote gender diversity and the e/uniFB00  orts being undertaken by the Executive Board’s Working Group on Gender Diversity to raise awareness of the beneﬁ  ts and importance of gender diversity. Since the 2019 D&I Report and at the time of writing, the number of female Executive Directors has increased from three at the end of FY 2019 to four/uni003B however, women still represent only 17 percent of Executive Directors. When Alternate Executive Directors are added, the share of women is 15 percent (8 of 52) with one Executive \nDirector vacancy.\n9\n9 Lundberg, Shelly, and Jena Sterns. 2019. “Women in Economics: Stalled Progress.” Journal of Economic \nPerspectives  33 (1): 3–22 - https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.1.3 .Figure 6.

It is equally critical to understand the three factors that contribute to the makeup of the population: inﬂ  ow (recruitment), career progression (promotion), and outﬂ  ow (separation). These are addressed in the next three sections, with speciﬁ  c challenges high-lighted to draw attention to where the focus should be placed in the coming three to four years to achieve the FY 2025 benchmarks.\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 8\nFigure 7.

This section sets out high-level key data related to trends in external recruitment.\nThe IMF has encountered uneven success in its diversity recruitment, similar to \ntrends in achieving diversity benchmarks. At the individual contributor level, the IMF has recruited su/uniFB03   cient nationals from East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to meet objectives/uni003B however, considerable struggles remain in recruiting from the MENA+ region and women into professional roles. Similarly, the low share of women and URR nationals hired into managerial roles is insu/uniFB03   cient to contribute to the achievement of the FY 2025 Benchmarks.\nIn FY 2021, 46 percent of external hires were sta/uniFB00  , and 54 percent were contrac-\ntual employees. As in previous years, the vast majority (67 percent) of all hires were into the A9–A15 or equivalent Professional (P) category for contractual employees. In the Support category (S for contractuals and A1–A8 for sta/uniFB00  ), a much higher ratio of contractual employees is being hired (1 in 2 vs. 1 in 8 sta/uniFB00  ). This reﬂ  ects the high number of Research Assistants hired as contractual employees. Managerial roles accounted for 4 percent of all external recruitments (Figure 7)./T_h  e IMF uses recruitment as its main tool to increase staﬀ   diversity. While adhering to the aim of \nrecruiting the highest-quali/f_i  ed candidates, it is strategically important to consider diversity in terms of gender, regional representation, as well as educational and professional background.\n2020–2021 Report 9\nTrends\nThe 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group recommended reducing the \nnumber of recruitment targets. For the period leading up to the end of FY 2025, the 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group proposed having only two external recruitment targets—one for women (50 percent) and the other for nationals from MENA+ (10 percent), both for roles in grades A9–A15 (individual contributors), so as to focus the IMF’s recruitment e/uniFB00  orts on the main challenges.\nSince the last report, the IMF has made some progress in increasing the share \nof MENA+ nationals recruited, but it remains below target and continues to lag behind in the share of women hired, which averaged 36.5 percent over the ﬁ  ve years to the end of FY 2021 (Figure 8). If these trends continue, the cumulative impact may result in longer-term consequences on diversity in leadership roles. Together with diversifying recruits into managerial roles, increasing the share of women and MENA+ nationals into the individual contributor category should be given priority in the coming years.\nOver the last ﬁ  ve years, women accounted for approximately 77 percent of hires \nin sta/uniFB00   grades A1–A8 and approximately 65 percent of contractual Support (S). These are slight increases compared to the ﬁ  ve-year averages reported in 2019 and were driven, in the case of sta/uniFB00   positions, by spikes in FY 2020 and FY 2021. The IMF is slightly more successful in recruiting women as contractual employees than as sta/uniFB00   into the P/A9–A15 levels (38 percent vs. 36 percent average over ﬁ  ve years, respectively). Greater variations are seen in external recruitments into managerial roles due to the low number of hires each year. Figure 9 depicts the ﬁ  ve-year trend in recruitment of women into the di/uniFB00  erent grade groups. Figure 8.

Starting in 2018, the mid-career recruitment process has gone through a fundamental change. It has focused more on sourcing candidates from URRs, is run at set times during the year and is governed by the Economist Committee—the same committee that oversees the Economist Program.\nRecruitment of mid-career fungible economists from URRs has improved. Since \nthe changes were implemented, except for FY 2019, the share of candidates hired from URRs has risen considerably, reaching over 50 percent in three of the ﬁ  ve reference years. Men from URRs, however, have far outpaced women from URRs. More generally, the share of women in the mid-career pipeline remains well below the 50 percent overall recruitment target (Figure 12).\n10 “Fungible economists” bring a variety of previous work experiences, often in areas of emerging focus for the \nIMF (climate change, for example). Mid-career hires undergo a competitive hiring process that includes a written \nassessment, preliminary interview, a mid-career panel interview, and Economist Committee clearance. They are then placed into a pipeline from which departments can select them.\nFigure 12.

On average over the last ﬁ  ve years, economists represented almost 65 percent of hires into the A9–B5 levels, with female economists averaging a third of economist hires. The share of male economists hired from URRs has been increasing steadily and reached 28 percent in FY 2021, 4 percentage points higher than the ﬁ  ve-year average (Figure 10, panel 3). On the other hand, the share of female economists recruited from URRs has remained constant. Among new hires, 36 percent were hired into Specialized Career (SCS) roles. Of these, slightly more than half were women, with an increase in the number of women from URRs hired in the last two years (Figure 10, panel 4).\nThe hiring of sta/uniFB00   from URRs into managerial roles, particularly women, remains \na considerable challenge. Over the last ﬁ  ve years, 59 percent of managers hired externally were men, of which one in ﬁ  ve were from URRs. Of the 24 women hired, three (12.5 percent) were from URRs—only 5 percent of external managerial recruitments (Figure 11).\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 12\nEconomist Program\nLike the mid-career process, recruitment into the Economist Program is central-\nized and continues to deliver better diversity results than individual hiring. In the ﬁ  ve cohorts from 2017 to 2021, the share of women recruited via the Economist Program has generally been more than 40 percent (Figure 13, panel 1), higher than the share of women graduating with PhDs in economics (between 30 and 35 percent). At slightly more than 36 percent, the share of URR nationals hired through this program has exceeded the 30 percent representation target set out in the Institutional Goals. Of the three underrepresented regions, nationals from East Asia were hired in higher numbers (Figure 13, panel 2). Continuing to increase the share of women and URR nationals recruited through this program will contribute to the pipeline of candidates for managerial roles in the long term.\nFigure 13.

As noted, few managers at the IMF are hired externally. /T_h  e policy of sourcing managers internally allows the IMF to grow its existing talent and provide career advancement opportunities. /T_h  is section presents recent trends in promotion rates in both the Economist and Specialized Career Streams.\nTrends for Economists\nThe average rate of promotion from A14 to A15 over the last ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nancial years \n(FY 2017 to FY 2021) is 4.1 percent. When comparing rates of promotion among di/uniFB00  erent regions (Figure 14, panel 1), nationals from sub-Saharan Africa have been promoted at a rate higher than the IMF average, which is a positive change compared to the ﬁ  ve years leading up to the end of FY 2019. For sta/uniFB00   from Asia (excluding East Asia), the rate of promotions is more than double the average, and sta/uniFB00   from many other regions are being promoted at rates similar to or above the IMF average, with the notable exception of Other Western Hemisphere.\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 14\nIn the ﬁ  ve years leading up to the end of FY 2021, women have seen a higher \naverage rate of promotion from A14 to A15 than men. For women from URRs, the average rate of promotion from A14 to A15 has increased by 1.2 percentage points to 4.5 percent (compared to the last reporting period FY 2015 to FY 2019) (Figure 14, panel 2). Women from Other Regions continue to be promoted at a rate above the IMF average. Even with higher rates for women, men from Other Regions are being promoted at a similar rate to the IMF average, though men from URRs were promoted at a rate slightly below the IMF average in the last 5 years.\nWhen looking at promotions from A15 to B1, the average rate for two regions \nis signiﬁ  cantly above the IMF average of 7 percent. Sta/uniFB00   from MENA+ and Asia (excluding East Asia), with average rates of 13.9 and 10 percent, respectively, have been promoted at much higher rates than that of other groups (Figure 15, panel 1). The rates of promotion for other groups have remained similar to the previous reporting period, with some small variances. More importantly, while the overall promotion rates are generally low (and di/uniFB00  erences are correspondingly “small”), it is important to understand the magnitude of these “small” di/uniFB00  erences. For instance, among Other Western Hemisphere, one in thirty sta/uniFB00   is promoted while the overall IMF average is one in fourteen. For comparison, among MENA+ nationals, one in seven sta/uniFB00   is promoted.\nThe average rate of promotion for women from URRs into B-level positions is \nmuch higher than during the previous reporting period but remains below the IMF average. In the period FY 2017 to FY 2021, the average promotion rate for women from URRs to B-level positions was 5.7 percent - an increase from 2 percent during FY 2015 to FY 2019 (Figure 15, panel 2). The ﬁ  ve-year average rate of promotion for men from Other Regions has increased to 6.3 percent from 5.1 percent. Similar to promotions from A14 to A15, the higher-than-average rate of promotions from A15 to B1 for women is driven by the promotion of women from Other Regions.Figure 15.

Half the regions, including Europe (excluding Transition Countries), MENA+, and East Asia, show average rates of promotion higher than the overall IMF average (Figure 16, panel 1). Similar to economists, sta/uniFB00   from MENA+ have beneﬁ  ted more from promotions than other regional groups, with the average rate jumping from 6.5 percent for FY 2015 to FY 2019 to 13.3 percent for FY 2017 to FY 2021. The average rate of promotion for sta/uniFB00   from Other Western Hemisphere remains below the average. Importantly, since FY 2015 (the start of the previous reporting period), the IMF has seen no promotions of nationals from sub-Saharan Africa for SCS sta/uniFB00  .Women from URRs have been promoted at a rate 1 percentage point higher than the IMF average. The average rate for men from Other Regions (3) is also above the average (Figure 16, panel 2)/uni003B whereas those for women from Other Regions and men from URRs are slightly below the average.\nThe 2019 D&I Report provided data on promotion rates from the A1–A8 grade \ngroup to A9 and above. Despite the low number and rate of such promotions, continued reporting on this group of sta/uniFB00   is important. Table 3 provides an over-view for the period FY 2017 to FY 2021. On an average annual population of 428, an average of 10 promotions occurred each year, though none took place in FY 2020 and only one in FY 2021, bringing the average down for the entire period. When comparing the average rates of promotion by gender and region (Figure 17), men from URRs have been promoted at a higher rate than the average. All other groups are in line with the IMF average.\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 16\nFigure 17.

The primary areas of focus should be on providing equitable opportunities for sta/uniFB00   development and strengthening the pipeline of eligible sta/uniFB00   for them to be in a position to:\n1.

The share of retirements is highest for A9-A15 sta/uniFB00  , in line with their overall population. The average rate of resignations over the last ﬁ  ve years is 1.5 percent. Women from Other Regions and men from URRs are resigning at slightly higher rates than the IMF average.\nTrends\nIn the ﬁ  ve years leading up to the end of FY 2021, the total number of separa-tions has averaged roughly 5 percent of sta/uniFB00  . Separations ranged from a low of 132 in FY 2018 to a high of 162 in FY 2017, with FY 2021 also seeing an increase to 160 (Figure 18, panel 1). In each year, the highest share of separations was due to retirements (on average 60 percent), followed by voluntary resignations (on average 27 percent), and ﬁ  nally other separations (on average 13 percent). In FY 2021, retirements accounted for more than two-thirds (67.5 percent) of separations.Figure 18.

Among this group, there was an average of 56 percent retirements, 30 percent voluntary resignations, and 14 percent other separations (Figure 18, panel 2). In FY 2021, the share of retirements in this grade group rose to 64 percent. Similar patterns are also observed for the other two smaller grade groups, B1–B5 and A1–A8.When looking at voluntary resignations, the average rate for FY 2017 to FY 2021 is 1.5 percent. Men from URRs and women from Other Regions continue to resign at a slightly higher rate than the average. Women from URRs resign at a considerably lower rate (Figure 19, panel 1).

This section provides a summary of the IMF’s organization-wide e/uniFB00  orts to foster a more inclusive environment.\n11  See broader evidence in McKinsey & Company (2018) - https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/\npeople-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity  on the business case for \ndiversity and inclusion.Racial Equity\nRacial equity and justice are now squarely on the IMF’s D&I agenda. The numerous well-publicized killings of black people by law enforcement o/uniFB03   cers in the United States, the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in many countries following the events in May 2020, and the increasing hostility toward Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic spurred the IMF’s Management and sta/uniFB00   into action to better understand race in the workplace and reiterate the commitment to the safety and equitable treatment of all sta/uniFB00   regardless of their race or identity.\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 20\nBox 1. Racial Equity Initiatives and Actions\nManagement reemphasized its zero tolerance for discrimination, bullying, \nand harassment. The IMF’s Managing Director (MD) and Deputy Managing Directors (DMDs) reached out to black employees and those from URRs to listen to the challenges they face at the IMF and committed to taking action to ensure any potential inequities are being addressed. The commitments included initiatives to be implemented in the short term: information and awareness campaigns, leveraging the Diversity Reference Group (DRG) community, and increased transparency on the allocation of annual perfor-mance review (APR) ratings and promotions, as well as more medium-term objectives such as exploring how to gather reliable quantitative and quali-tative data, a review of the mandate and process of the Review Committee, giving the Inclusion and Diversity Council (I&D Council) a more robust mandate, and actions arising from a D&I Survey.Black employees mobilized to create learning opportunities and propose concrete initiatives. A new Employee Resource Group (ERG), the Network of Black Sta/uniFB00  , was created and met regularly with Management and the D&I O/uniFB03   ce. ERG members’ practical proposals as to measures the IMF could take to address internal racial equity and justice have resulted in the hiring of a Senior Race Expert and the creation of a Racial Equity and Justice Advisory Group. The Advisory Group, comprised of members from within and outside the IMF, is tasked with providing advice, recommendations, and guidance on redressing racial inequity and its consequences within the IMF and will deliver a report outlining a broad strategy and recommended actions in early FY 2023. \nDiversity Resource Groups (DRGs) and regional groups came together to create the Racial Justice and Equity Speaker Series. The aim of this series is to provide learning opportunities for employees to understand the history of race in the United States, the impact of racial inequity on people of color, and how organizations can foster greater inclusion and equity. Since June 2020, eight events have taken place, many attended by more than 350 partic-ipants each, and the IMF Library created an Anti-Racism Resource Center to provide employees with materials on the topic.Departmental management teams a/uniFB03   rmed their support to racially diverse colleagues. Many held townhall meetings/uni003B provided safe spaces for employees to discuss their individual and collective challenges, both within and outside the IMF/uni003B o/uniFB00  ered resources/uni003B and worked actively with their DRGs to provide occasions to improve knowledge around racial justice and equity.\nThese collective e/uniFB00  orts have led to broad acceptance that racial equity needs more prominence within the IMF. In addition to the work of the Advisory Group mentioned above, the D&I O/uniFB03   ce has been working with key stakeholders on a voluntary self-identiﬁ  cation survey, which will include race/ethnicity, to gain a better view of the share of sta/uniFB00   of di/uniFB00  erent racial backgrounds in the IMF. These data, complemented by the results of a D&I Survey will provide valuable insights and allow better targeting of IMF initiatives. \n2020–2021 Report 21\nSponsorship Program\nAs a key recommendation from the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality \n(EDGE) recertiﬁ  cation in 2019, the IMF established a formal Sponsorship Program. It will allow strong-performing individuals from underrepresented groups to be supported by a senior manager (Sponsor) who has knowledge of their work and can vouch/advocate for equity in treatment in terms of access to senior leaders, career-enabling assignments, career development, and career advancement opportunities. Sponsorship currently exists informally, but a formal corporate program will help mitigate the potential bias that stems from existing arrange-ments and beneﬁ  t a wider pool of sta/uniFB00  . In the longer term, the program should also bring about greater progress toward the benchmarks.\nWhile EDGE recommended a Sponsorship Program for women, the IMF’s pilot \nprogram focuses on nationals from URRs. The IMF’s data show that URR nationals do not have easy access to career-enabling assignments and have not beneﬁ  ted from career advancement at the same rate as other regional groups. Sta/uniFB00   from URRs also shared that they often lack networks and role models because of the low number of their compatriots in managerial roles.\nThe pilot program’s objective is to address this low representation of URRs in key \npipelines for managerial roles and in managerial roles themselves. Although not the goal of the IMF’s program, research\n12 shows that sponsorship may result in \nhigher rates of promotion for the targeted groups. It also allows the organization to beneﬁ  t from the contributions of a broader range of talent and “hidden gems,” who can contribute in meaningful ways. Greater engagement and career satis-faction of the sponsored individuals may also contribute to greater retention of talent, helping build the relevant pipelines.\nThe initial cohort for the pilot program consists of 26 pairings. Senior Managers \nwere asked to volunteer as Sponsors, whereas Participants (those being sponsored) were put forward by departments based on a number of criteria, including grade level, track record of good performance, openness to feedback and coaching, evidence of being goal oriented, interest in working in other \n12 Hewlett, Sylvia Ann with Kerrie Peraino, Laura Sherbin, and Karen Sumberg. 2010.

Boston: Harvard Business Review Research Report.departments, and willingness to engage in networking activities when neces-sary. Sponsors and Participants were matched based on areas of work and work history, with careful attention being paid to ensuring no direct line of reporting between each pair.\nSponsors and Participants have been provided with training. As the concept \nof formal Sponsorship is new to the IMF, it engaged a leading industry vendor to deliver workshops and provide tips and tools for success. The workshops, complemented by a playbook, addressed the following areas:\n1. Di/uniFB00  erences among mentoring/coaching/sponsorship\n2. Sponsor and Participant roles and responsibilities\n3. The importance of relationship capital\n4. Key activities and actions for a successful sponsorship relationship\n5. Building chemistry\nThe D&I O/uniFB03   ce will accompany the cohort throughout the two-year pilot period. \nRegular check-ins are planned to gather feedback and address questions and concerns. In addition, the D&I O/uniFB03   ce will facilitate peer meetings to allow each group, Sponsors and Participants separately, to share best practices and raise challenges in a safe environment. A survey will be conducted in early FY 2023 to take the pulse and course adjust if needed.\nFinally, the IMF will measure success and apply learnings from the pilot to open \na fully-ﬂ  edged program targeting a much wider audience. A set of perfor-mance indicators and measurements to assess the success of the pilot are being ﬁ  nalized. The aim is to take lessons learned from the two-year pilot and adapt the model, where necessary, prior to extending the roll out to a broader set of Participants. Given that the number of sta/uniFB00   put forward for the initial pilot exceeded the number of available slots, the IMF may launch a second cohort, in FY 2023, if feedback after the initial 9- to 12-month period is positive.\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 22\nDisabilities\nIn the 2019 Report, the IMF committed to broaden the scope of its D&I activities \nto encompass more underrepresented groups. In December 2006 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities .\n13 The IMF aims to gradually align, as much as possible, with this \nConvention. It embarked on this journey in FY 2021 and aims to continue making progress over the next several years. The D&I O/uniFB03   ce is engaging with key stake-holders to implement the necessary changes.\nThe IMF has relaunched its former Working Group on People with Disabilities. \nThe aim of this interdepartmental Working Group is to review the IMF’s current disability-related policies and practices and make proposals on potential improvements. The group will benchmark against similar organizations and the private sector to identify best practices for implementation.\nThe D&I O/uniFB03   ce worked with sta/uniFB00   to create an Employee Resource Group dedi-\ncated to employees with disabilities and those who care for dependents with disabilities. The aim of this group is to provide an a/uniFB03   nity group, similar to those for other communities in the IMF, and to leverage its knowledge and experiences to ensure that policies, practices, IT tools, buildings, social media, and the like are accessible for all.\nThe IMF is lagging signiﬁ  cantly behind its peers in embracing and actively \npursuing disability as a diversity priority. Many have in place clear policies and centralized budgets for reasonable accommodations, have implemented tools to make their internal and external websites accessible, and are increasing their e/uniFB00  orts to recruit people who identify as having a disability. The IMF is seeking to become current, meet minimum standards of accessibility, and increase its e/uniFB00  orts to accommodate and hire people with disabilities.\n13 Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities - \nhttps://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.htmlDiversity and Inclusion Training\nMandatory trainings on unconscious bias and workplace harassment have been in place since 2018. These trainings, o/uniFB00  ered respectively by the D&I and Ethics O/uniFB03   ces, were updated in 2021 to provide employees with more recent and engaging content. All o/uniFB00  erings are through e-learning, allowing employees to take them at convenient times and at their own pace within a deﬁ  ned deadline. These courses complement other diversity-related training such as Inclusive Interviewing Skills, components included in the Leadership Development Program o/uniFB00  erings and general management training courses related to perfor-mance management, communication, and managing teams. In addition, in response to requests from sta/uniFB00   and managers, courses on racial equity and mental health are currently being tested, launching by the end of FY 2022.\nUse of Preferred Pronouns\nEmployees may use their preferred pronouns in their IMF signature on a volun-tary basis. In recognition of the growing number of people who do not identify as either male or female and following a successful IMF GLOBE (Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Employees)\n14 event in May 2020 on the use of appropriate pronouns, \nCSF/Creative, with the support of the D&I O/uniFB03   ce and Management, agreed that sta/uniFB00   could indicate their preferred pronouns in their o/uniFB03   cial IMF signature (see example). The use of correct pronouns is a sign of respect for and accep-tance of sta/uniFB00  ’s di/uniFB00  erent identities generally, but especially those within the LGBTQ+ community. It goes some way to enabling sta/uniFB00   to bring another aspect of their identities to work – an important component of fostering an inclusive work environment.\n14  IMF GLOBE is the a/uniFB03   nity group/sta/uniFB00   club dedicated to persons of the LGBTQ+ community.\n2020–2021 Report 23PETRA DE BRUXELLES\n(she/her/hers)\nDiversity & Inclusion Advisor\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\n\nThe work on Diversity & Inclusion is conducted under the leadership and guid-\nance of the D&I O/uniFB03   ce, but many across the IMF champion their own initiatives to foster a more diverse and inclusive work environment. Key partners for the D&I team are the departmental Diversity Resource Groups (DRGs) and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) or sta/uniFB00   clubs. Box 2 provides a few examples of innova-tive initiatives implemented by these champions, to address challenges they h a v e  i d e n t i ﬁ e d .\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 24\nBox 2. IMF Staﬀ   Diversity and Inclusion Intiatives\nTalks by Charitable Organizations\nTo present a culture that is compassionate, inclusive, and empathetic to the \nneeds of others, one IMF DRG invited four nonproﬁ  t charitable organiza-tions to present their role and how they impact quality of life for people who are facing challenges. To build solidarity in the department, sta/uniFB00   were also provided with information about volunteering opportunities and ways they could contribute.Safe Space to Share Tough Experiences\nAs a demonstration of support for colleagues, a DRG from one IMF depart-\nment set up informal sessions and discussion fora on racial equity in which sta/uniFB00   were given the space to share their experiences of racism and racial equity following a departmentwide survey on the same issue.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion Assessment\nSupported by their department’s managers, another IMF DRG conducted a \ndepartment-wide survey to assess sta/uniFB00   perceptions of D&I issues. The survey was followed by thematic listening circles at which sta/uniFB00   could discuss the concerns raised. Racial Inclusion, Policymaking, and Economic Outcomes\nAnother sta/uniFB00   group organized a panel discussion between IMF sta/uniFB00   and \nexternal experts to raise awareness about the disproportionate economic and health e/uniFB00  ects of COVID-19 on racial minorities.\nAdvances Inclusion and Cohesion\nChinese sta/uniFB00   members held a virtual Lunar New Year gathering and farewell \nparties and started IMF Chinese Sta/uniFB00   Association (CSA) newsletters to share work and life achievements. In addition, CSA leadership sought members’ input on their career development challenges and discussed ways in which they could be overcome.Advances Inclusion and/uni00A0Equity\nIMF GLOBE, which supports gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender \nemployees, worked with the D&I O/uniFB03   ce to design the D&I Survey LGBTQ+ inclusive and established a Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity (SOGI) Analytical Working Group, which seeks to explore and understand the added value of nondiscriminatory policies toward LGBTQ+ populations to promote inclusive policy design.\n/T_h  e 2019 Diversity and Inclusion Report identi/f_i  ed accountability as a primary \nchallenge the IMF faced in achieving its diversity objectives.\nThis ﬁ  nding was also supported by the 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working \nGroup, which in its Report of November 2020 indicated “For the e/uniFB00  orts promoted by HRD and D&I O/uniFB03   ce to succeed, they have to be owned by departments and have buy-in from all managers.”\n15 Recognizing the need to strengthen account-\nability for D&I results, the IMF has rolled out several initiatives in the last two years. Signiﬁ  cant e/uniFB00  orts have been deployed to improve accountability IMF-wide, including at the departmental, and individual manager levels, a summary of which follows. More generally, to keep the IMF on track, a Three-Year Framework was developed and presented to Management. Regular updates are provided on the status of initiatives against the timeline set out in the Framework. As many of the initiatives are ongoing, assessing their impact will be possible only in the medium to long term.\nSignaling from the Highest Level\nManagement rea/uniFB03   rmed its commitment to Diversity & Inclusion. In September 2020, a new Diversity and Inclusion Statement\n16 was published on the IMF \nexternal website. The statement rea/uniFB03   rmed that “The strength of the Fund comes from its talented and diverse employees” and clariﬁ  ed that each individual is responsible for contributing to D&I at the IMF. The statement also sets out a number of commitments, such as attracting, retaining, and developing diverse talent/uni003B enforcing management accountability/uni003B and overcoming explicit and implicit biases.\n15 Report on The 2025 Benchmarks - http://www-intranet.imf.org/departments/HumanResources/Programs/\nDiversity/Documents/2025 Diversity Benchmarks Presentation to Board v10.pdf , November 12, 2020.\n16 Diversity and Inclusion statement - https://www.imf.org/external/hrd/diversity.htmSetting the FY 2025 Benchmarks\nThe 2025 Diversity Benchmarks Working Group was constituted in September 2019 and completed its work in June 2020. The remit of the Working Group was to assess progress against the 2020 Diversity Benchmarks, formulate the new 2025 Benchmarks, and recommend policy solutions, which were endorsed by Management and presented to the IMF’s Executive Board. In setting the FY 2025 Benchmarks, the Working Group underscored that ambition needs to strike a balance with realism and equity, and identiﬁ  ed four anchors: Equitable, Principled, Inclusive, and Clear (EPIC):\n• Equitable: aiming for gender balance\n• Principled: balanced shares of URR based on quota & IMF business\n• Inclusive: a more holistic approach wherein everybody counts (contractual \nemployees and A1-A8)\n• Clear: simpliﬁ  ed framework\nTo achieve the benchmarks, the Working Group also recommended initiatives \nconcerning policies and practices. These were grouped into several topical areas: attracting diverse sta/uniFB00  /uni003B using incentives, ownership, and accountability/uni003B empha-sizing retention and career progression/uni003B and developing inclusion metrics and benchmarks. Some of the recommendations overlapped with existing or planned initiatives/uni003B others were new.\n2020–2021 Report 25\nDepartmental Diversity and Inclusion \nAction Plans\nWithout accountability at the departmental level, the IMF cannot achieve its \nD&I objectives. In November 2020, with the support of the I&D Council, the D&I O/uniFB03   ce rolled out Departmental D&I Action Plans in which Heads of Departments (HoDs) committed to high-level actions and more tangible initiatives. The plans provide departments with an overview of the diverse composition of their teams (stock) as well as the ﬂ  ow (external recruitments).\nThe full impact of the departmental D&I action plans can be appropriately \nmeasured only after a few years. An initial review at the end of FY 2021, however, shows that:\n• Implementation of concrete departmental D&I Action Plans has been a \npositive step in the IMF’s D&I journey as it has raised more awareness around challenges within individual departments.\n• Departments have set SMART objectives with concrete actions/initiatives to increase diversity in their teams and monitor diversity in key career develop-ment processes.\n• Departments are thinking more carefully and being more intentional about expanding sourcing to reach previously untapped candidate pools.\n• Many departments have been deﬁ  ning “career-enabling” assignments.\nAccountability Framework\nFor many years the IMF Accountability Framework (AF) has been the primary means of holding Heads of Departments accountable for achieving business results. The AF comprises a mix of business and people management indi-cators against which HoDs are evaluated and rewarded. Management meets twice yearly with each HoD to assess progress against the AF objectives and to course-adjust priorities as needed. In the past, the discussions have primarily focused on business results—those related to key achievements related to serving the membership or key business processes. In December 2020, a clear signal emerged as to the importance Management attributes to people manage-ment, including diversity and inclusion. The agenda inverted the order of the discussions/uni003B D&I and other human resource indicators were reviewed before business-speciﬁ  c results. This shift has been a signiﬁ  cant one in the culture of performance management for senior managers.Diversity and Inclusion Survey\nIn March 2021, HRD launched a D&I Survey. The survey asked sta/uniFB00   (including contractual employees) to voluntarily self-identify across di/uniFB00  erent diversity dimensions—a ﬁ  rst step in collecting broader diversity data—and sought sta/uniFB00   perceptions and experiences at the IMF related to belonging, inclusion, their managers, training & leadership development, and discrimination and harass-ment. The response rate of 43 percent compares favorably with similar surveys and allowed the team to extract valuable insights. This survey sets a benchmark against which the IMF will be able to measure progress in the coming years and hold managers accountable for creating a more inclusive, equitable, and safe working environment.\nThe survey highlighted several issues of signiﬁ  cant concern. More speciﬁ  cally, \nsome sta/uniFB00   reported not feeling valued or respected due to their identity/uni003B experi-encing and witnessing unconscious bias, discrimination, and harassment/uni003B being reluctant to report for fear of retaliation/uni003B or lacking trust in the IMF’s safeguarding mechanisms. On a positive note, a vast majority of respondents reported that their manager (in this case direct supervisor) creates a safe and trusting work environment for all team members, regardless of their identity.\nThe Management Team, including Heads of Departments, is strongly committed \nto addressing the challenges identiﬁ  ed. A plan of immediate next steps has been identiﬁ  ed, with the aim of engaging in a bottom-up exercise to solicit more medi-um-term and sustainable actions.\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 26\n/T_h  e strategic importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion is becoming increasingly accepted \nas a business priority that will help the IMF better serve its membership. /T_h  e D&I sphere is ever evolving: addressing its related challenges is and will be a continuous journey. In the two years since the last report, while maintaining a keen focus on gender and regional representation, the IMF has embarked on a path to broaden the scope of diversity dimensions included in its portfolio and made strides to improve inclusiveness and strengthen accountability for achieving results.\nThe IMF must keep in step with the evolving D&I landscape and ensure that, at \nminimum, it meets the same standards it is asking of its stakeholders. In addition to continuing to pay close attention to two main priorities for hiring and sta/uniFB00   development—gender and underrepresented regions—the IMF needs to take a more granular look at what it has actually achieved so far. For example, there has been progress in the share of women in managerial roles, but disparities exist among the women who have beneﬁ  ted from these e/uniFB00  orts. The topic of inter-sectionality, the conﬂ  uence of di/uniFB00  erent diversity dimensions such as gender and race or race and sexual orientation, is becoming more prominent. In future, it will become more important to look at the intersections of a broader set of diversity dimensions to identify and address unintended gaps that have emerged.\nThe D&I Survey revealed that very few employees are aware of what the IMF does \nto accommodate people who identify as having a disability. In the next two years it proposes to raise the visibility of this important diversity dimension by engaging with its existing community of colleagues and external parties to evaluate current policies and accommodation practices, with a view to better enabling not only current employees, but also potential candidates, reassuring them that the IMF will address their reasonable accommodation needs, if hired.\nTo achieve benchmarks, the IMF will focus its e/uniFB00  orts on external recruitment and \ndeveloping existing talent so that they are ready to take on managerial roles. More speciﬁ  cally, the IMF will leverage the additional hiring space provided by the business priority areas—climate change, gender inclusion, digital ﬁ  nance, and closer engagement with fragile and low-income states—and the increase in sta/uniFB00   retirements. Table 4 sets out the recommended areas of focus and initiatives to be taken to address ongoing challenges.\n2020-2021 Report 27\nTable 4.

The pay gap analysis \nhas been mainly focused on di/uniFB00  erences in pay by gender and underrepresented regions. In 2020, for the ﬁ  rst time, the analysis relied on newly collected survey data to include race. The framework used in the estimations of the pay gap is fairly standard (see below) and is largely based on that used for the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) certiﬁ  cation.\nGender pay gaps and pay equity more generally remain a hot topic for human \nresources discussions and policies. Traditionally, studies have largely focused on gender and tend to show signiﬁ  cant di/uniFB00  erences in remunerations that are hard to explain. At the same time, pay gap analyses have also become more sophis-ticated and have moved away from simple comparison of average pay across di/uniFB00  erent groups (e.g., men and women) and have sought to incorporate the main determinants of pay to pinpoint the e/uniFB00  ect of gender or race.\n18 At the IMF, an early \nstudy found no major systematic gender pay di/uniFB00  erences based on data from 1999–2013\n19.\nAs noted above, the IMF has been conducting more regular pay gap assessments since 2017, in the context of the EDGE certiﬁ  cation. To understand di/uniFB00  erences in pay across gender and other factors (such as race) a regression analysis focused on pay has been used. The standard framework used here allows one to assess whether the gender pay di/uniFB00  erences remain (a pay “gap”) after controlling for additional factors that could potentially a/uniFB00  ect internal salaries. The baseline esti-mated equation below follows EDGE’s standard regression form, which includes personal characteristics such as age, tenure, performance ratings and educational level, as well as job-related factors such as department type and career level.\nThe latest pay gap analysis is based on data for FY 2020 and looks at gender, \nregion, and race.\n20 The data used include salaries and other individual char-\nacteristics of 2,800 IMF sta/uniFB00  , including age, tenure, nationality, or region, etc. \n18 See PWC (2017 ) - https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/economics/insights/women-in-work-index.html  and Payscale \n(2021) - https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap .\n19 Maloney, Tim. 2015. “Final Report on the Salary and Career Progression Equity Study.” AUT Enterprises Limited, \nAuckland.\n20 Due to the sample size, for this PGA an analysis was possible only for two groups, one Afro/Black and the second \nregrouping all other races/ethnicities.In addition, survey data were used to estimate the pay gap between sta/uniFB00   who self-identiﬁ  ed as Afro/Black and the non-Afro/Black group. The survey data cover only about 40 percent of the larger sample and relies on data provided by sta/uniFB00   on a voluntary basis.\nThe results from the pay gap analysis show relatively small di/uniFB00  erences in pay \nacross gender and race. In the regressions considered, the combined e/uniFB00  ect of age, tenure,  educational level, years in grade, and grade level all have a positive and signiﬁ  cant impact on pay and explain most of the variation in sta/uniFB00   salaries (Annex Figure 1.1)/uni003B the same variables also explain most of the di/uniFB00  erences in pay across gender and race. The following ﬁ  ndings are robust to a number of empir-ical checks, and applying the same framework to FY 2019 and FY 2016 shows broadly similar results.ANNEX 1.\nAnnex Figure 1.1 IMF Economist Salaries, FY 2021\n(In salary)\n14.0\n13.6\n13.2\n12.8\n12.4\n12.0\n11.6\n11.2\n10.8\n10.410.0\n-2 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22  25 28 31 34 37 40ln(salary)\nTOTAL YEARS OF FUND SERVICE\nWomen Men\nSources: HR Prod/uni003B and IMF sta/uniFB00   calculations. Data include both sta/uniFB00   and contractual employees.\n2020–2021 Report 31\nIn the case of gender, the results indicate that the pay gap is generally small, \nespecially for economists (55 percent of IMF sta/uniFB00  ). In the sample, pay for women is about 3.8 percent lower than that for men, after controlling for the other factors previously mentioned. This overall gap is close to the +/–5 percent overall pay gap in similar industries and in line with EDGE speciﬁ  cations.  In the case of econ-omists, the di/uniFB00  erence across gender is only –0.9 percent, and it is not statistically signiﬁ  cant. On the other hand, the di/uniFB00  erences across gender are larger, –5.4 percent for women, when considering sta/uniFB00   in specialized career streams (which in turn might reﬂ  ect di/uniFB00  erent levels of the pay gap for a large number of distinct job functions).\nIn the case of URR the e/uniFB00  ects are also generally small. In the baseline estimations \nused to assess the gender pay gap, the inclusion of URR does not alter the main results but indicates a small negative pay gap for URRs (below 5 percent). More speciﬁ  cally, the estimated coe/uniFB03   cient on the URR variable indicates a pay gap of –1.8 percent (about half of gender coe/uniFB03   cient), and the coe/uniFB03   cient is statis-tically signiﬁ  cant at the 5 percent level. Interestingly, the coe/uniFB03   cient is larger than in previous analyses using FY 16 and FY 19 data, and this trend will continue to be monitored closely.\nFinally, in the case of race, the analysis zoomed in on the pay gap between \nAfro/Black and the rest of the sample (all other groups). As noted earlier, the sample used in this case is about 40 percent of the sta/uniFB00   (about 1,200 observa-tions), based on the number of respondents to a question on race/ethnicity. In particular, the coe/uniFB03   cient on the Afro/Black variable is –0.3 percent, and it is not statistically signiﬁ  cant. Worth noting: some sta/uniFB00   perceive a large pay gap based \non race—these views do not align with the analysis. Other factors, such as career progression, may be contributing to these perceptions.\n21 Given that only 15 percent of sta/uniFB00   self-identiﬁ  ed as Afro/Black, no additional subgroups (e.g., Afro/Black econo-\nmists) were analyzed with this framework owing to the rather small sample sizes.\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 32\nANNEX 2.\nAFRICA \n(sub-Saharan )ASIA \n(excluding East Asia )EAST ASIA \n(ASEAN+)EUROPE ( excluding \nTransition Countries )MIDDLE EAST & NORTH \nAFRICA+ (MENA+)TRANSITION \nCOUNTRIESOTHER WESTERN \nHEMISPHEREU.S. AND \nCANADA\nCC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country\nAGO Angola* AUS Australia BRN Brunei Darussalam* ABW Aruba AFG Afghanistan* ALB Albania AIA Anguilla CAN Canada\nBDI Burundi BGD Bangladesh CHN China* AND Andorra ARE United Arab \nEmiratesARM Armenia ARG Argentina USA United States\nBEN Benin* BTN Bhutan HKG Hong Kong SAR* ANT Netherlands Antilles BHR Bahrain* AZE Azerbaijan ATG Antigua and Barbuda\nBFA Burkina Faso* FJI Fiji IDN Indonesia* AUT Austria DJI Djibouti* BGR Bulgaria BHS The Bahamas\nBWA Botswana* FSM Micronesia JPN Japan* BEL Belgium DZA Algeria* BIH Bosnia and HerzegovinaBLZ Belize\nCAF Central African Republic*IND India KHM Cambodia* BMU Bermuda EGY Egypt* BLR Belarus BOL Bolivia\nCIV Côte d'Ivoire* KIR Kiribati KOR Korea* CHE Switzerland IRN Iran* CZE Czech Republic BRA Brazil\nCMR Cameroon* LKA Sri Lanka LAO Lao P.D.R.* COK Cook Islands IRQ Iraq* EST Estonia BRB Barbados\nCOD Democratic Republic of the Congo*MDV Maldives MAC Macao SAR* CUW Curacao JOR Jordan* GEO Georgia CHL Chile\nCOG Republic of Congo* MHL Marshall Islands MMR Myanmar* CYM Cayman Islands KWT Kuwait* HRV Croatia COL Colombia\nCPV Cabo Verde* NIU Niue MYS Malaysia* CYP Cyprus LBN Lebanon* HUN Hungary CRI Costa Rica\nCOM Comoros* NPL Nepal PHL Philippines* DEU Germany LBY Libya* KAZ Kazakhstan CUB Cuba\nERI Eritrea* NRU Nauru SGP Singapore* DNK Denmark MAR Morocco* KGZ Kyrgyz Republic DMA Dominica\nETH Ethiopia* NZL New Zealand THA Thailand* ESP Spain MRT Mauritania* LTU Lithuania DOM Dominican Republic\nGAB Gabon* PLW Palau VNM Vietnam* FIN Finland OMN Oman* LVA Latvia ECU Ecuador\nGHA Ghana* PNG Papua New Guinea FRA France PAK Pakistan* MDA Moldova GRD Grenada\nGIN Guinea* SLB Solomon Islands FRO Faroe Islands QAT Qatar* MKD North Macedonia GTM Guatemala\nGMB The Gambia* TLS Timor-Leste GBR United Kingdom SAU Saudi Arabia* MNG Mongolia GUY Guyana\nGNB Guinea-Bissau* TON Tonga GIB Gibraltar SDN Sudan* MTN Montenegro HND Honduras\nGNQ Equatorial Guinea* TUV Tuvalu GRC Greece SOM Somalia* POL Poland HTI Haiti\nKEN Kenya* TWN Taiwan Province of ChinaIRL Ireland SYR Syria* ROM Romania JAM Jamaica\nLBR Liberia* VUT Vanuatu ISL Iceland TUN Tunisia* RUS Russia KNA St. Kitts and Nevis\nLSO Lesotho* WSM Samoa ISR Israel WBG West Bank & Gaza* SRB Serbia LCA St. Lucia\nMDG Madagascar* ITA Italy YMN Yemen* SVK Slovak Republic MEX Mexico\nMLI Mali* LIE Liechtenstein YEM Yemen* SVN Slovenia MSR Montserrat\nMOZ Mozambique* LUX Luxembourg TJK Tajikistan NIC Nicaragua\nMUS Mauritius* MCO Monaco TKM Turkmenistan PAN Panama\nMWI Malawi* MLT Malta UKR Ukraine PER Peru\nNAM Namibia* N\n LD The Netherlands UVK Kosovo PRY Paraguay\nNER Niger* NOR Norway SLV El Salvador\n2020–2021 Report 33\nAFRICA \n(sub-Saharan )ASIA \n(excluding East Asia )EAST ASIA \n(ASEAN+)EUROPE ( excluding \nTransition Countries )MIDDLE EAST & NORTH \nAFRICA+ (MENA+)TRANSITION \nCOUNTRIESOTHER WESTERN \nHEMISPHEREU.S. AND \nCANADA\nCC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country CC Country\nNGA Nigeria* PRT Portugal SUR Suriname\nRWA Rwanda* SMR San Marino TTO Trinidad and \nTobago\nSEN Senegal* SWE Sweden URY Uruguay\nSLE Sierra Leone* SXM Sint Maarten VCT St. Vincent and the Grenadines\nSSD South Sudan* TUR Turkey VEN Venezuela\nSSN South Sudan* VGB British Virgin Islands VIR Virgin Islands\nSTP São Tomé and Príncipe*\nSWZ Eswatini\nSYC Seychelles*\nSWZ Swaziland*\nTCD Chad*\nTGO Togo*\nTZA Tanzania*\nUGA Uganda*\nZAF South Africa*\nZMB Zambia*\nZWE Zimbabwe*\nCC—Country Code\n*Under-Represented Region (URR)\n1/ Updated October 2021\nIMF Diversity and Inclusion O/uniFB03   ce 34\nANNEX 3.\nTable 1.

THE FRAMEWORK FOR ACCESS TO IMF RESOURCES\\nQuota-based access limits\\n• The credit tranches (mainly accessed through Stand-By Arrangements)\\nand the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) are subject to the same access limits.\\nThese consist of an annual limit of 100 percent of quota and a cumulative limit\\nof 300 percent of quota. The annual limit applies to gross purchases in any 12-\\nmonth period. The cumulative limit applies to credit outstanding, less sched-\\nuled repurchases, plus scheduled purchases, over the period of commitment of\\nresources. These limits may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Aver-\\nage annual access has been fairly stable at around half of the annual limit in\\nrecent years (see Figure II.2).\\n• Access under the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) is subject to its\\nown limits. These limits are cumulative, and include limits of 45 percent of\\nquota each for access under the export shortfalls and excess cereal imports ele-\\nments, and a combined limit of 55 percent of quota. These limits cannot be\\nexceeded.\\n• The amount of emergency assistance for natural disasters and for post-\\nconflict cases is limited, in any one instance, to 25 percent of quota. Larger\\namounts can be made available on an exceptional basis in post-conflict cases.\\nEmergency assistance was until recently subject to the access limits under the\\ncredit tranches but was converted into a facility and excluded from these\\naccess limits, pending further review.\\nAccess to other facilities\\n• The Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) is not subject to explicit access\\nlimits.

The annual limit applies to gross purchases in any 12-\\nmonth period. The cumulative limit applies to credit outstanding, less sched-\\nuled repurchases, plus scheduled purchases, over the period of commitment of\\nresources. These limits may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Aver-\\nage annual access has been fairly stable at around half of the annual limit in\\nrecent years (see Figure II.2).\\n• Access under the Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) is subject to its\\nown limits. These limits are cumulative, and include limits of 45 percent of\\nquota each for access under the export shortfalls and excess cereal imports ele-\\nments, and a combined limit of 55 percent of quota. These limits cannot be\\nexceeded.\\n• The amount of emergency assistance for natural disasters and for post-\\nconflict cases is limited, in any one instance, to 25 percent of quota. Larger\\namounts can be made available on an exceptional basis in post-conflict cases.\\nEmergency assistance was until recently subject to the access limits under the\\ncredit tranches but was converted into a facility and excluded from these\\naccess limits, pending further review.\\nAccess to other facilities\\n• The Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) is not subject to explicit access\\nlimits.

This section\\ndescribes the current structure of policies and facilities; earlier lending\\ninstruments are noted in BoxII.5.\\n20Members have the option of combining all repurchases due within a calendar month,\\nprovided that the combined repurchase is completed not later than the last day of the\\nmonth and that no single repurchase remains outstanding for a period exceeding the maxi-\\nmum permitted under the relevant policy of the IMF.\\n21A comprehensive discussion of the evolution of IMF lending instruments is available\\non the web: “Review of Facilities—Preliminary Considerations,” www.imf.org/external/np/\\npdr/fac/2000/index.htm.\\n39']"
